It was his wife who even shared the sad news of his death on Facebook. The post reads;</p><p>“James Alexander, 8 Jan 1978 – 28 April 2023<br>To say my heart is broken would not do justice to the 22 years we spent together. This year I’ve crossed a rubicon: I’ve spent more of my life with you, than without. I can not imagine having to do life without you by my side. You were my first love, my best friend, my work-buddy, travel-buddy, there’s-something-in-your-teeth-buddy.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The first person to break my heart and then mend it again. The only person to witness me, all of me: the good, the bad, the pajamas….You were magic, a unicorn, and everybody knew it. You loved people and they loved you. And oh, how you made us laugh! You haven’t just fought a good fight, my baby, you fought the best fight.</p><p>I have never witnessed anybody endure the amount of physical pain and losses and disappointments you have had to over the last 5 years and do it with such grace and integrity, whilst all the time fiercely believing and surrendering to God’s plan. You finished the race well, the suffering is over.</p><p>Now Rest In Peace, my Jamie. Cancer might have won the battle for your body, but your soul was never beaten. I will always love you xxx<br>(James was diagnosed with head an neck cancer in Jan 2019. It was his wish to keep his fight private until he was ready to share it. He was unfortunately not granted that opportunity, but his legacy will live on, as one does not go through the fire unchanged.)”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>James Alexander Age</h2><p>At the time of his death, he was 45 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>James Alexander Family</h2><p>He was married to Anel Alexander.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>James Alexander Net Worth</h2><p>At the time of his death, his net worth was not known.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>www.ghgossip.com</a></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqOYpp2jYq6tsdeapZ2domKwosHSnmSonl2ZsqLAx2aYoJ1dm66utcuyZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
