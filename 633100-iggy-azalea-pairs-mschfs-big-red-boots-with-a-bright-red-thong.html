She is someone who is constantly posting on her Instagram page, and more often than not, she is giving fans some thirst traps. Overall, <a href=# rel>these thirst traps have certainly ramped up</a> since she created her OnlyFans. This OF page was created as a way to help promote her music. Consequently, she has seen an uptick in sales. Moreover, she has seen some huge returns when it comes to her overall earnings.</p><p>Now that she is making this kind of content, she can do a better job of capitalizing on certain trends. One of those trends is none other <a href=# rel>than the Big Red Boots that were released by MSCHF today.</a> These boots are known for their peculiar construction. Additionally, they are pretty massive and aren't exactly convenient. However, plenty of people love these right now, and they are the perfect piece of footwear if you are <a href=# rel>trying to get off a fit pic on Instagram</a>. Apparently, Iggy has been attempting to do just that.</p><span><h2 id=h-iggy-azalea-stuns>Iggy Azalea Stuns</h2></span><p>In the Instagram post above, Iggy can be seen wearing a pair of the Big Red Boots. Additionally, she was wearing a white cropped long-sleeve and a bright red thong. The post was then captioned with the phrase "Big red boots for a big boss bitch." Clearly, Iggy Azalea was feeling herself while wearing these massive boots. It also helps that she was getting off of a private jet which just adds to the aesthetic. Moreover, Iggy wrote her name on the bottom of one of the boots which is giving big Andy from Toy Story vibes.</p><p>With this latest Instagram post, perhaps Iggy will inspire more people to go out and cop these kicks. Of course, that could be a hard sell considering just how tough these are to pull off. However, if you want to flex on your friends, then you may just have to get these. Not to mention, Iggy looks so good in these that she may just very well be a convincing enough vessel for these things. Let us know what you think of the big red boots, in the comments below.</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaIByfI9moKCfqWKuu63LnphmqJGev7R5zKyaoZ6jYq%2Bqs4yrnJ1lkqS8tb%2BMsKCtoF2WeqO%2ByKCfrWWimrFuwMeopaA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
