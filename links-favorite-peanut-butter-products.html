According to Good Mythical Morning’s Link, the answer to that riddle is simple: peanut butter. Today, Mythical’s very own Peanut Butter Boy (and reigning <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lord of the Nuts</a>) shared a list of his five favorite peanut butter products with us, all of which he tried previously on episodes of Good Mythical Morning.&nbsp;</p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Little Debbie’s Peanut Butter Cream Pie</strong></a><p>Link loves Peanut Butter Cream Pies so much that when he first tried one, it blew the memory of ever eating it straight out of his head. (Allegedly). During a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Debbie’s Gut Check</a> episode, he said, “I think we’ve had it on the show and my mind was blown and then I forgot about it.” When (re-)tasting the Little Debbie snack during the Gut Check, Link described it as a “big round <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nutter Butter</a>.” But unlike Nutter Butters, the Little Debbie snack is made up of two fluffy cookies and is super chewy. The chewiness, in particular, made Link like it even more than Nutter Butters (which we assure you he adores, especially in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">milk form</a>… anyone remember the Nutter Butter teat?). The only thing left to make the Peanut Butter Cream Pie perfect, according to Link, is to dunk it in “creamyyy milk.”</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">We Tried EVERY Little Debbie Snack</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Ben & Jerry’s Peanut Butter World Ice Cream</strong></a><p>Just before Link tried Ben & Jerry’s Peanut Butter World ice cream during the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben & Jerry’s Gut Check</a>, Link said that he would be a tough judge of the peanut butter ice creams. After all, he is a peanut butter expert (self-proclaimed, but I think we can all agree that no one loves peanut butter like Link). But when he tried it, his face lit up. He said, “Wow. I can’t believe I’ve never had that.” Indeed, the milk chocolate ice cream with swirls of chocolate cookie and peanut butter went on to win the episode, and it’s safe to say that Link stands by it to this day.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">We Tried EVERY Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream Flavor</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Reese’s Pumpkin Peanut Butter Cups</strong></a><p>According to Link, Reese’s Pumpkin Peanut Butter Cups are the best peanut butter candy out there. How would he know that? Well, he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tried every peanut butter chocolate candy</a> side-by-side, and the Reese’s Pumpkin Cups were the best. Not only that, but Link liked them better than the original. (Yes, by original I mean Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups!) The ratio of peanut butter to chocolate is totally different with the Pumpkin Cups. They have way more peanut butter. But that raises an important question, which Link took a moment to address: “I love peanut butter… Is it too much?” Obviously the answer was no. Even though there is less chocolate on the outside—and it’s different from the original—Link enjoyed the “smoothness” it had. And while he was mildly disappointed that it didn’t taste like pumpkin, he had this to say: “Reese’s, it’s blazing a trail and they’re winning!”</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Peanut Chocolate Candy Taste Test</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Keebler’s Peanut Butter Dreams Cookie</strong></a><p>Link recommends Keebler’s Peanut Butter Dreams Cookie, which he tried on GMM during the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Keebler’s Gut Check episode</a>. The cookies are delicious little rings with peanut butter, crunchy peanuts, and fudge. All of these different textures led Link to say that it has a “good consistency.” He also picked up on a “perfect little douse” of caramel. The cookie itself is chocolatey, unlike the majority of peanut butter cookies on the market, which typically have a vanilla base. This choice of chocolatiness, Link expressed, is a sign that Keebler has “really done a good thing.”</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">We Ate All 33 Keebler Cookies At Once (Taste Test)</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Jif Peanut Butter</strong></a><p>The ultimate peanut butter product is, of course, peanut butter itself. Just plain old, good old peanut butter. So, when we asked Link what his favorite peanut butter was, he mentioned Jif, and referred us back to an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">old GMM episode</a>, where he blind tasted the most popular creamy peanut butter brands. While Link grew up with Peter Pan’s peanut butter and was—at the time the episode aired—a self-proclaimed Skippy man, the slight sweetness of Jif’s peanut butter won him over. It’s also the peanut butter Keebler uses in their Peanut Butter Dreams Cookie!</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">What’s The Best Peanut Butter?
