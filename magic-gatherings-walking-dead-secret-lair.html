Each of these, bundled together in a Secret Lair – products that are only available to pre-order for a minuscule window – features unique mechanics not found on any other card which, combined with their status as legal in several formats such as Commander, has led to criticisms that the company has resorted to making meta-relevant cards far too short in supply."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Considering attempts to boycott this Walking Dead&nbsp;collaboration largely failed to make a meaningful impact, though, it’s unlikely that any change of trajectory will be happening anytime soon.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=685 data-injectable=false>It goes without saying, then, that many more Secret Lairs featuring art and characters from other pop culture shows will be making their way to <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> in the months and years ahead. For now, though, let us know what you think of Heggen’s reveal in the usual place below!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZopJqfmZh6qK3ToZyroZ6cwG7DwKWioqaXYrGmrcNmqp6boprBbrjAoqlo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
