He appeared in the theatrical adaptation of the Japanese manga “Itazura Na Kiss.”</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Joe_Cheng_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Joe Cheng? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>As of 2022, sources estimate a net worth of more than $3 million, obtained primarily from a successful acting career. He is most known throughout Asia, particularly in Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, the Philippines, China, and Hong Kong. It is projected that his wealth will expand as he advances in his career.</p><h2><span id=Joe_Cheng-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Joe Cheng- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>Joe was born on June 19, 1982, in Beitun, Taichung, Taiwan. Cheng was up in Beitun District and was primarily reared by his father when his parents divorced when he was in primary school, with his elder sister living with her mother. He began his career with the Catwalk Modeling Agency, where he swiftly achieved success during his first year, with various projects garnering attention.</p><h2><span id=Joe_Cheng-_Relationship_Girlfriend>Joe Cheng- Relationship, Girlfriend</span></h2><p>Despite his prominence in the entertainment world, Cheng is notorious for keeping much of his personal life hidden from prying eyes. One of his most well-known romances was with Taiwanese singer and actress Ariel Lin, with whom he rose to fame in “It Started with a Kiss” — she later received a Best Actress award for their work in “They Kiss Again.” They got along well at work, but their romantic connection ended quickly, and she eventually married businessman Charles Lin, who was introduced to her by common colleagues; Joe and Ariel are now good friends. Cheng hasn’t been reported to be in any other relationships, so he’s still single — he’s stated in an interview that he admires women who are dedicated to their profession.</p><h2><span id=Joe_Cheng-_Professional_Career>Joe Cheng- Professional Career</span></h2><p>He appeared in a number of music videos, including one by Jacky Cheung. In 2003, he had his first acting role in the Taiwanese drama “The Rose,” in which he co-starred with the female band S.H.E and Cecilia Yip. The part helped launch his acting career, and he later appeared as a guest performer in the idol drama “Dance with Michael.” He would next star in two plays, “Magic Ring” and “Nine-Ball,” all of which were moderately popular. The next year, he landed the main part in “It All Began with a Kiss.”</p><h3><span id=Fame_in_Acting_and_Other_Activities>Fame in Acting and Other Activities</span></h3><p>“It Started with a Kiss” catapulted Cheng to celebrity, receiving strong ratings in Taiwan and spreading throughout Asia. This was his first project with actress Ariel Lin, with whom he would later collaborate on the sequel “They Kiss Again.” They also co-starred in “Love or Bread,” which had nothing to do with their prior two pictures. More work began to come in for him, and he appeared in serials made in Japan, China, and Taiwan while continuing to model for major brands such as Adidas.</p><p>Cheng has also participated in catwalk presentations for Christian Dior, Timberland, and Marc Jacobs, as well as the launches of Hugo Boss flagship stores. His other sponsorships include Kang Shifu, a green tea brand, and N+a, a clothing company. Over the course of his career, he has also issued four calendars, a small pictorial, and three pictorial volumes. He has also co-authored a book on his hometown, in addition to publishing two other novels. He was also featured in a book published by his modeling agency. In 2009, he received an Asia Model Festival Award and was named an ambassador for World Vision.</p><h3><span id=A_Career_in_Music>A Career in Music</span></h3><p>Joe took less television work in 2009 to focus on a stage project, his theatre debut named “Design for Living,” in which he would star alongside Sylvia Chang, and which would have multiple sell-outs shows in Asia, including Taiwan, Singapore, China, and Hong Kong. During the same year, he also released his debut EP, “Sing a Song” – he’s been known to enjoy singing – and while his record sold well in Taiwan, it failed to gain traction in the rest of the world.</p><p>Joe is also pursuing his education as a student at Hsing Wu College, where he is studying tourism management part-time. He also volunteered for National Service and served in the Taiwan Coast Guard’s second regiment. In 2010, he performed in the Korea Foundation for International Culture Exchange’s 7th Asia Song Festival, which was held at the Seoul Olympic Stadium.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Mahbod Moghadam</a>, <a href=#>Kwhxte</a>, and <a href=#>Renata Jara</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Will Patton</a></h3>Will Patton is a podcast narrator and actor best known for his role as Colonel Dan Weaver in TNT's science fiction series Falling Skies.Patton has appeared in the films Halloween Kills (2021), Hal <a href=# class=vmagazine-lite-related-more>Read More</a> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Who Is Alexander Skarsgard’s Wife?
