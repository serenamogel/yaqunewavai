Wonka's wish to liberate his buddies purifies his desire to succeed in the chocolate business: he's not just doing it for himself and his mum, he's doing it for them, too. But it's a rocky road to victory. The script is relentless in its willingness to force Wonka to&nbsp;take two steps back for every three&nbsp;forward (which Chalamet actually does in a scene where he's walking down steps, an homage to something <a href=#>Gene Wilder</a> also did in the 1971 film; you don't often see a metaphor conveyed by an actor's footwork).&nbsp;</p><p>Even the most elaborate plans unravel due to unforeseen circumstances or the villains’ influence, requiring on-the-spot&nbsp;improvisation, which fortunately is something Wonka and Noodle are good at. And when all else fails, this is a fantasy—sometimes a cartoonish one. We're never entirely clear on how many resources the down-and-out Wonka actually has at his disposal, and what we do see makes us wonder if he's an otherworldly creature whose only limitations are conditioning or psychology. The chocolate-making "travel kit" that he carries is practically a tiny factory that&nbsp;seems to have its own power source. When&nbsp;he finally does get to open his own chocolate shop (come on, now, like you thought he wouldn't get to do it?) it's up and running overnight, without a worry as to where to get the money, the materials, the permits, and the army of contractors required to make it happen. It's all quite&nbsp;cheeky, though, like the transition in "<a href=#>The Blues Brothers</a>" where <a href=#>Cab Calloway</a> is told that he needs to stall for time at the theater where the big show is supposed to occur, and there's a cut to a curtain going up to reveal Calloway and the band in on a 1930s&nbsp;Art Deco set wearing white tuxedos and&nbsp;launching into "Minnie the Moocher."</p><p>"Wonka" is not only unapologetic in its contrivances, manipulations, and absurdist embellishments,&nbsp;it lets its goodhearted trickster hero&nbsp;and a few other characters comment upon them—not as blatantly as a Bugs Bunny or Deadpool might,&nbsp;but practically. Nathan Crowley's production design, Lindy Hemming's costumes, and Chung-hoo Chung's cinematography create a universe that has a certain grittiness and&nbsp;is connected to reality through economic distress,&nbsp;but is otherwise&nbsp;the audiovisual equivalent of one of Wonka's candies. There's a class system here, and the one percent rules over everyone else.&nbsp;But there's no racism (it’s a multicultural cast).&nbsp;"Wonka" avoids complaints that Wonka's future factory workers, the Oompa-Loompas, are imperialistic caricatures of nonwhite people&nbsp;by casting <a href=#>Hugh Grant</a> as the lone example, a chocolate thief who visits Wonka when he's asleep, and making him sort of an English leprechaun obsessed with his own version&nbsp;of the fabled&nbsp;pot-o'-gold.&nbsp;Dahl's tendency to equate conventional beauty&nbsp;with virtue and ugliness with nonstandard body types is also mostly AWOL here, save for the&nbsp;the running gag of having the corrupt police&nbsp;chief swell up from all the bribe-candy he consumes.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46wpqejkWKzqrjMZqmerpmaxG5%2Bj2tq</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
