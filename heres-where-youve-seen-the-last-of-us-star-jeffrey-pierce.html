His first role came in the police procedural Pacific Blue, before being thrown around the crime drama ring with appearances in Without a Trace, NCIS, Criminal Minds, CSI, The Mysteries of Laura, and many more.</p><p data-characters=114 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true>The Colorado-born actor also had roles in The Sarah Conner Chronicles, Knight Rider, and Love, Death, and Robots.</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>Pierce has not been limted to just television and film, though, with an extensive resume as a voice actor in video games. Pierce was one of the voice actors for Prototype in which he played The Specialist, and also had voice roles in three Call of Duty games.</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=false>Astonishingly, Pierce was even in the original The Last of Us video games, doing both the voice and the performance capture for Tommy Miller in the Naughty Dog games. Surely not a coincidence, he’s now appearing in The Last of Us live-action adaptation , albeit as a different character.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1pr7ErGSwoJWnsm7Fzq6tnmWjmrKvedOhnGakkajBbrvFZqysZaOprrN5yZ6dn6qVrnqxtcSrmp5n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
