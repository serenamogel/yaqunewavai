With its rising popularity, All of Us Are Dead is predicted to dethrone the survival drama as the most-watched original series on the streaming site.</p><h2>All of Us Are Dead’s storyline</h2><p>The horror series revolves around a group of adolescents in a high school where a terrible epidemic is spreading. Anyone infected soon transforms into a zombie intent on annihilating the survivors. When obtaining outside assistance becomes more difficult, the remaining party is forced to confront the undead and do all in their ability to avoid joining their rapidly swelling numbers.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/All-of-Us-are-Dead-2.jpg alt="All of Us are Dead" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>All of Us Are Dead is not like previous zombie programs or flicks.</h2><p>The Netflix series addresses the zombie thriller genre with a huge plot change. Unlike previous shows such as Train to Busan, Alive, and Sweet Home, which featured adults attempting to escape an apocalypse, this one places adolescents in a similar life-threatening predicament.&nbsp;According to director Lee Jae-Kyoo, there is a specific rationale for making high school kids the show’s protagonists. It was done to demonstrate the huge contrasts in choices made by a toddler and an adult when confronted with a dangerous circumstance.</p><p>“Up until recently, most zombie movies centered on grownups. This series, on the other hand, recounts the life of kids who have yet to completely grow and socialize.”</p><p>We’ve seen that in movies like Train to Busan, where the protagonist nearly always tries to do the right thing based on well-thought-out rationale. Teenagers, on the other hand, tend to make “riskier judgments.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/All-of-Us-are-Dead-1.jpeg alt="All of Us are Dead" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“When adults are placed in a hazardous position, they will all find a safer route out.” Children, on the other hand, make riskier choices. I wanted to create a narrative that would inspire people to consider what it means to be an adult and a person by seeing the children’s choices and behaviors in a life-or-death scenario.”</p><p>Netflix is presently showing all twelve episodes of All of Us Are Dead. While the open-ended ending of Season 1 suggests a second season, it has not yet been formally announced.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYpaRdpLNuwdJmmKudXZmyorCMoqpmpp%2BserPBy6KloGWknbJur8eaqa2rXaS7bsDHnmSnnaSbuarEjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
