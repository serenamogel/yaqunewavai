Juliet Kadungure had never publicly published any information about a boyfriend or spouse before to her sad death, other than on social media. Her private life remained just that: private.

If Juliet Kadungure did have children, she managed to keep them away from the prying eyes of the media and the limelight.&nbsp;Her capacity to keep her family life private from public scrutiny demonstrates her commitment to privacy.&nbsp;It is impossible to determine if she left behind children in the absence of precise facts regarding her parenthood.&nbsp;If Juliet did have children, it is reasonable to assume that her family, especially the Kadungure family, would look after their well-being and offer whatever assistance and care they may need in the aftermath of this tragic loss.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihrqSZmsFut8CdrKefpaeybrTUrJmappRixKm7jLCYrGWjnbJuucCrqaKdlGLBsHnKopusZZGjsW6ywKagpbFf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
