However, there was one time in her life that nerves got the best of her — to the extent that she opted out of something she wanted: a date with Elvis Presley."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She was only 16, 11 years younger than 27-year-old Sonny, at the time, and their relationship started off platonic, with Cher even admitting in a 2018 SiriusXM documentary The Cher Show: Making the Musical, that Sonny specifically <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/music/cher-sonny-bono-didnt-find-her-particularly-attractive/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said to her" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said to her</a>, “I don’t find you particularly attractive,” during the early days of their friendship.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I was with my girlfriend, who was really beautiful,” she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/music/cher-sonny-bono-didnt-find-her-particularly-attractive/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said of their first meeting" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said of their first meeting</a>. “He liked her so he didn’t really say anything to me. He was like, ‘Oh yeah, kid.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Eventually, as their music careers skyrocketed, so did their love for one another — and things turned romantic. They got married, first in a faux ceremony in 1964 and then officially in 1969.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That tight connection from the time she was young meant didn’t quite know what to do when the marriage ended in 1974.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I had been married to Sonny for so long, 11 years” she recalls to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/personality/david-letterman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="David Letterman" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">David Letterman</a> in a 2010 interview. “So when I got out, I was really excited, but I wasn’t quite with it.”</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Cher was 'too frightened' to spend a weekend with Presley</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That lack of confidence likely got in the way of what could have been yet another epic marriage of musical greats. She admits that of all the suitors that did come her way, the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll was definitely the one that got away.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She also revealed in the same Letterman interview that she “almost” went on a date with Presley, but it never happened.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I got nervous,” she said. “I didn’t get there. I was that nervous.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She revealed on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/cher-dishes-on-dating-tom-cruise data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2013" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2013</a> that Presley had invited her to spend a weekend with him, but she didn’t. “I was just too frightened.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Though the exact timing of when the date-that-never-happened occurred is unclear, presumably it happened in Presley’s later years since he <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/news/elvis-priscilla-presley-relationship-marriage-divorce data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=divorced class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">divorced</a> his wife <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musician/priscilla-presley data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Priscilla Presley" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Priscilla Presley</a> in 1973, leaving both megastars single around the same time.

But she also added on that Presley wasn’t her only regret. “<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actor/marlon-brando data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Marlon Brando" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Marlon Brando</a> too. I wish I had.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As Letterman continued naming famous men, she interjected: “What is this? This is My Life in men? It’s come to that?! This is beneath you.” While the audience broke into laughter, the talk show host simply stated, “These are famous people you’ve known in your life. You’ve led a very interesting life.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The legendary singer, also known for her breakthrough movie roles like in 1987’s Moonstruck, was then back to her surprising ways, teasing, “There’s a lot more than that.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But she soon brought it back down with a reality check. “We’re not talking <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/news/cleopatra-mark-antony-love-story-death data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cleopatra numbers" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Cleopatra numbers</a>… the truth is, everyone was more promiscuous than me.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That statement could be up for interpretation as she went through her top five greatest lovers <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/tv/cher-talks-tom-cruise-during-andy-cohen-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="to Cohen" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">to Cohen</a>. Reluctant to rank them, she said, “Well, a lot of them kind of came in first — I just had the greatest lovers ever.”</p><img alt="Cher at the Academy Awards on March 24, 1986 in Los Angeles, California.
