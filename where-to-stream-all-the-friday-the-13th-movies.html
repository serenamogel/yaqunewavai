As a testament to this somewhat ragtag approach, producer and director Sean S. Cunningham pre-emptively took out a full-page ad in Variety featuring the Friday the 13th logo in 1979 as a way to gauge interest in the movie before writer Victor Miller’s screenplay was even complete.</p><p data-characters=572 data-current-count=572 data-injectable=true>However, the creators pulled off the gambit as the film was a hit, though it wasn’t nearly as acclaimed from a critical standpoint as the movies it paid homage to, such as the Michael Myers slasher and Psycho. Nevertheless, the original movie spawned 10 sequels, including the crossover <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Freddy vs. Jason</a> featuring A Nightmare on Elm Street villain Freddy Krueger and a reboot in 2009. There was even a television show, Friday the 13th: The Series, which ran in syndication from 1987 to 1990, but it is currently only available on a DVD box set released by Paramount.</p><h2 id=h-where-can-i-watch-all-of-the-friday-the-13th-movies data-injectable=false>Where can I watch all of the Friday the 13th movies?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/friday-the-13th-8.png><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=611 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Most but not all</a> of the Friday the 13th movies are available on more than one streaming platform.

Specifically, a prequel series called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Crystal Lake has been greenlit</a>, with a rumored 2024 release, on the streaming service Peacock. The show appears to be in good hands as well since it is being brought to life by Hannibal producer Bryan Fuller with the Oscar-winning studio A24.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGdopp6tbuMrKurnZGieqK4y2aroZ1dm7%2BqsMCyZK2glWJ%2BdMDHZqSorpmawHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
