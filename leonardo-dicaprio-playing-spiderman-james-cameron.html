Electro and Sandman would have been the main villains, but neither those character nor the general plot and tone of the movie would have shared much in common with the comic books.
Now, DiCaprio has finally revealed just how close he came to playing Spider-Man, and it doesn’t sound like he was ever fitted for a costume, that’s for sure."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, seeing as Cameron’s Spider-Man movie sounded so offbeat and weird, there’s a chance that it would have been a massive flop along the lines of Batman and Robin, so it’s certainly possible&nbsp;that it wouldn’t have done his career many favours had that been the case.</p><p data-characters=109 data-current-count=109 data-injectable=false>Tell us, do you wish DiCaprio had played <strong>Spider-Man</strong>?
