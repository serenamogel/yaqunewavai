The first season came out in 2022 and the second came out in 2023, allowing viewers to feel relief in not having to wait for too long to find out what comes next in the story.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-the-marked-heart-about data-injectable=false>What is The Marked Heart about?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=257 data-injectable=false>The show focuses on Simón (Michel Brown), a man whose wife, Valeria, is abducted and murdered so that her heart can be transplanted to Camila (Ana Lucía Domínguez), the new wife of a millionaire ruthless enough to do anything to save the woman he loves.</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true>Seeking revenge for the death of his wife, an enraged Simón plunges into the shadowy and dangerous world of black market organs. Camila, questioning how she received a transplant when she was far down on the list of recipients, begins to investigate the potentially nightmarish origin of her new heart. When the two meet, an unlikely but powerful love begins to form between them.</p><p data-characters=519 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>The Marked Heart was created and written by Colombian author, actor, and screenwriter Leonardo Padrón and is based on his own original idea rather than a real-life incident. The series is set and was filmed in Padrón’s native Colombia and several Bogotá landmarks are featured prominently throughout the show including the Quinta de Bolívar, the José Celestino Mutis botanical garden, the Maloka Museum, and the Planetarium of Bogotá. The series was directed by Camilo Vega and produced by CMO Producciones.</p><h2 id=h-is-the-marked-heart-based-on-a-true-story data-injectable=false>Is The Marked Heart based on a true story?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Camilo Vega (@vega.camilo)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=426 data-current-count=726 data-injectable=true>Although the series is wholly original, the organ trade, sometimes known as the “Red Market,” does exist. It is illegal to sell human organs everywhere except in Iran, but there is a constant shortage of organs needed for transplant. The scarcity of available resources and the desperation of those seeking to save their own lives or the lives of their loved ones often leads individuals to take drastic measures.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>Most of the illegal trade involves taking advantage of people living in poverty and being encouraged or threatened to sell their own organs, but abductions of unwilling “donors” are not uncommon — though perhaps not as common as urban legend would have people believe.</p><p data-characters=179 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>According to an article by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MagellanTV</a>, negative economic factors and so-called “Transplant Tourism” are by far the most mitigating factors in the illegal organ trade.</p><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Cinemaholic</a>, Padrón has said he consulted with experts to ensure that the black market elements of the series were portrayed both authentically and sensitively. However, one element of the story may raise a few skeptical eyebrows. It is heavily implied that Valeria’s heart, living in Camila’s body, is responsible for the depth of feeling between Camila and Simón.</p><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=803 data-injectable=true>The evidence for such a phenomenon appears to be anecdotal at best, but one woman, Claire Sylvia, has written a book called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">A Change of Heart</a> that claims her organ transplant resulted in fundamental changes to her personality that bore resemblances to the traits of her donor. Whether Camila’s attraction to Simón is based on this or is just a fantastic notion of Padrón is up to viewers to decide.</p><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=172 data-injectable=false>With the show’s continued success, it is definitely a possibility that a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">third season</a> could be on the horizon. At this time, however, there has been no confirmation.</p><p data-characters=94 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>In the meantime, the first two seasons of The Marked Heart are currently streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKKrXam1pnnMmqmknZRitaat0a1kqKZdo7K1ssuir2aho2K2tXnBmqqenF2ku26tjK2prp1dqMGwvtho</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
