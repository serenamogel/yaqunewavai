He opposed his country’s role in World War II and became so despondent about the war that he considered <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/6943088/Tsutomu-Yamaguchi.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="killing his wife and infant son" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">killing his wife and infant son</a> with sleeping pills if Japan lost.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Yamaguchi was in Hiroshima for a three-month business trip when the city was bombed on August 6, 1945.

Suddenly, he said the sky lit with a blaze, “the lightning of a huge magnesium flare.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Drawing upon his naval air-raid training, Yamaguchi dove to the ground, rolled into the nearest irrigation ditch, flung his hands into his head, locked his fingers over his eyes, and jammed his thumbs into his ears, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1538121786 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="To Hell and Back: The Last Train from Hiroshima" data-vars-ga-product-id=8f2d515a-65db-4015-9d44-f519599874f2 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1538121786 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1538121786 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1538121786 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"c754abb3-3204-4f94-a191-fe83f09385e4","site_id":"73ce8f33-abd8-4d76-b5c7-1c72caf717ce","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand="Rowman & Littlefield Publishers" data-vars-ga-product-price=$22.11 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=26c0451b-09be-4759-985e-6d8d33ed8858 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Rowman & Littlefield Publishers" class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">To Hell and Back: The Last Train from Hiroshima</a> by Charles Pellegrino.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The ground roared and an ear-shattering noise ripped through the air, tossing Yamaguchi into the air as a fireball imploded overhead.
