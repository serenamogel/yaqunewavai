Debris flow, earth flow, rock fall, mudflow, mudslide, slide, and slump are also terms for landslide.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=was-there-a-corrupt-bargain-in-the-election-of-1824></span>Was there a corrupt bargain in the election of 1824?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The Corrupt Bargain<p>In the 1824 presidential contest, <b>Jackson did not publicly advocate for his own election</b>, in keeping with the tradition of the day. … They elected John Quincy Adams, with House Speaker Henry Clay as Adams’ chief supporter.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-political-smear></span>What is a political smear?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A smear campaign, also referred to as a smear tactic or simply a smear, is an effort to damage or call into question someone’s reputation, by propounding negative propaganda. It makes use of discrediting tactics. It can be applied to individuals or groups.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-causes-a-mud-slide></span>What causes a mud slide?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Landslides are caused by disturbances in the natural stability of a slope. They can accompany heavy rains or follow droughts, earthquakes, or volcanic eruptions. Mudslides develop <b>when water rapidly accumulates in the ground and results in a surge of water-saturated rock, earth, and debris</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-causes-mud-flow></span>What causes mud flow?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Mudflows can be caused by <b>unusually heavy rains or a sudden thaw</b>. They consist mainly of mud and water plus fragments of rock and other debris, so they often behave like floods. They can move houses off their foundations or bury a place within minutes because of incredibly strong currents.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-damage-can-be-done-by-a-mudslide></span>What damage can be done by a mudslide?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Mudslides are powerful natural events which can carry heavy debris at more than 20 mph towards homes and buildings. They can cause <b>severe damage to land, crops, livestock, structures, and human life</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-landslide-a-calamity></span>Is landslide a calamity?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Landslides occur when ground on slopes becomes unstable</b>. … Given the nature of such disasters, fast relief and rescue operations are required to get to trapped survivors but this can be delayed due to landslides cutting off easy access to the affected area.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-landslide-a-natural-disaster></span>Is landslide a natural disaster?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>When large areas of soil become saturated on steep slopes, the pull of gravity causes the top layers of the soil to slide downhill, therefore resulting in a landslide. … They are <b>a deadly and unpredictable type of natural disaster</b> and are the leading reason for landslides or Rock falls occurring worldwide.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-landslide-pdf></span>What is landslide PDF?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A landslide occurs wh<b>en stability conditions</b> of the slope is disturbed either by the increase. of stress imposed on the slope and / or by the decrease in strength of the earth material. building up the slope and it involves enmass downward movement of earth material under. the influence of gravity.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-flood-landslide></span>What is flood landslide?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Landslides and flooding are closely associated because both are <b>related to intense rainfall, runoff and ground saturation</b>. … In turn, flooding can cause landslides, due to rapidly moving floodwaters, which often undercut slopes or abutments.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-landslide-ppt></span>What is landslide PPT?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Definition A landslide, also known as a landslip, is a geological phenomenon that includes a wide range of ground movements, such as rock falls, deep failure of slopes and shallow debris flows. Landslides can occur in offshore, coastal and onshore environments.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-land-sliding></span>What is land sliding?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A landslide is defined as <b>the movement of a mass of rock, debris, or earth down a slope</b>. … Earthquake shaking and other factors can also induce landslides underwater. These landslides are called submarine landslides. Submarine landslides sometimes cause tsunamis that damage coastal areas.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-topple-landslide></span>What is topple landslide?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Topples. Topple failures involve <b>the forward rotation and movement of a mass of rock, earth or debris out of a slope</b>. This kind of slope failure generally occurs around an axis (or point) at or near the base of the block of rock. A good example of a site experiencing topple failures is Aldbrough, UK.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-debris-avalanche-in-geology></span>What is a debris avalanche in geology?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Definition of debris-avalanche<p>: <b>a mass of rock fragments and soil that has moved rapidly down a steep mountain slope or hillside and because of its high water content has behaved like an avalanche of</b> snow — compare debris-slide.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-4-types-of-landslides></span>What are 4 types of landslides?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Landslides are part of a more general erosion or surficial pro- cess known as mass wasting, which is simply the downslope movement of earth or surface materials due to gravity. They are classified into four main types: <b>fall and toppling, slides (rotational and translational), flows and creep</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-land-sliding-and-explain-its-causes-in-your-own-words></span>What is land sliding and explain its causes in your own words?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A landslide is the movement of rock, earth, or debris down a sloped section of land. Landslides are <b>caused by rain, earthquakes, volcanoes, or other factors that make the slope unstable</b>. Geologists, scientists who study the physical formations of the Earth, sometimes describe landslides as one type of mass wasting.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-landslides-class-9></span>What are landslides Class 9?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A landslide is described as <b>a mass of rock, debris or earth moving down a slope</b>. Landslides are a form of mass waste under the direct influence of gravity, that indicates any down-slope movement of rock and soil. The word landslide encompasses five forms of slope movement, topples, falls, spreads, slides and flows.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-slide-geology></span>What is slide geology?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A slide happens <b>when a section of soil or rock suddenly gives way and moves down a slope</b>. The material moves as a single mass along a slippery zone. The slippery zone is often made up of wet sediment .<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-2-types-of-landslide></span>What are the 2 types of landslide?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>movements are included in the general term “landslide,” the more restrictive use of the term refers only to mass movements, where there is a distinct zone of weakness that separates the slide material from more stable underlying material. The two major types of slides are <b>rotational slides and translational slides</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-block-slide></span>What is block slide?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A block slide is <b>a translational slide in which the moving mass consists of a single unit or a few closely related units that move downslope as a relatively coherent mass</b> (fig. 3C).
