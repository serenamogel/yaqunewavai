It definitely saved my life.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Five studio albums, four <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-weeknd/chart-history/top-album-sales data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="No. 1 Billboard hits" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">No. 1 Billboard hits</a> and three Grammys later, The Weeknd is now among the top-selling artists worldwide. Here are 10 things you may not know about the Canadian singer, who will headline the 2021 Super Bowl halftime show in Tampa Bay on February 7.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">He’s trilingual</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The son of Ethiopian immigrants, The Weeknd grew up outside Toronto in a multicultural neighborhood filled with fellow East Africans, as well as people from India, the Middle East and the Caribbean. “Ethiopian — Amharic — was the first language I learned to form sentences in because my grandma, who raised me with my mom, would not speak English,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2020/music/news/the-weeknd-exclusive-interview-after-hours-1234573754/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Variety class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Variety</a>. “Because of television and being in Canada, I learned English too, but I went to French-immersion school, where you’d get in trouble for speaking English, and I couldn’t speak it to my grandma, so it’s almost like English is my third language, even though now it’s my first.”</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">He has a special connection to Jim Carrey</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Weeknd also told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2020/music/news/the-weeknd-exclusive-interview-after-hours-1234573754/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Variety class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Variety</a> that fellow Ontario native <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jim-carrey data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jim Carrey" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jim Carrey</a>’s 1994 comedy The Mask was the first movie his single mother, Samra Tesfaye, took him to see in theaters when he was 4 years old. “It blew me away,” he said, adding that it fueled his dream of one day attending film school. Nearly three decades later, the men were introduced over text, and The Weeknd invited Carrey to his Los Angeles condo to hear some new music in 2019.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As it turned out, not only did they discover that they lived in the same neighborhood — and even got out telescopes to wave to each other — but Carrey also knew the exact theater his mother took him to see The Mask. “On my [30th] birthday, he called and told me to look out my window, and on his balcony he had these giant red balloons, and he picked me up and we went to breakfast,” The Weeknd recalled. “It was surreal. Jim Carrey was my first inspiration to be any kind of performer, and I went to breakfast with him on my first day of being 30.”</p><img alt="The Weeknd" title="The Weeknd" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-149837484.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Daniel Boczarski/Redferns via Getty Images</span><p>The Weeknd in 2012</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">He initially wanted to spell his stage name differently</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During a 2013 Reddit AMA, the singer revealed that <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.mtv.com/news/1714103/the-weeknd-reddit-ama/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he “hated” his given name" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">he “hated” his given name</a> and, in his late teens, decided to use the moniker “The Weekend,” instead, because it “sounded cool.” There was one problem, however: a Canadian rock band already existed, so he removed the “e” to avoid copyright issues. According to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vice.com/en/article/7bexag/how-the-producer-of-the-weeknds-breakout-tracks-got-majorly-screwed data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="music producer Jeremy Rose" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">music producer Jeremy Rose</a>, however, he and his fellow musician used “The Weekend” as a collective name, but his former collaborator dropped the “e” after a falling out in 2010.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">His trademark former hairstyle was a pain — literally</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Weeknd says his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7564798/the-weeknd-cutting-hair-dreadlocks-didnt-feel-right-starboy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="trademark dreadlock hairstyle" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">trademark dreadlock hairstyle</a> — which was inspired by artist <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/artists/jean-michel-basquiat data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jean-Michel Basquiat" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a> — caused him to sometimes wake up with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/sex-drugs-and-rb-inside-the-weeknds-dark-twisted-fantasy-176091/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="neck pain" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">neck pain</a>. He kept the style anyway so that he didn’t end up looking "like everyone else,” also wanting to be remembered as “iconic and different.” In 2015, he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/sex-drugs-and-rb-inside-the-weeknds-dark-twisted-fantasy-176091/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rolling Stone</a> that he’d “probably cut it” if it started to interfere with his sight, however.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He eventually <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.gq.com.au/grooming/hair/the-weeknd-just-cut-his-famous-hair/news-story/821e3baf995fb1ed9f1eb0c9e974eaec data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="lopped his hair off" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">lopped his hair off</a> in 2016, debuting his new short-haired look on the album artwork for Starboy. “I think I felt a single tear come down my cheek,” he later joked in an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/dec/03/the-weeknd-abel-tesfaye-interview-music-tom-lamont data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Guardian" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Guardian</a>, adding that he’d also missed the anonymity he could get from wearing baseball caps.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">He worked at American Apparel</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Before he made it big, The Weeknd worked folding shirts at an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/magazine/can-the-weeknd-turn-himself-into-the-biggest-pop-star-in-the-world.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="American Apparel" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">American Apparel</a> retail store in downtown Toronto around 2010.

The pair, along with another friend, Hyghly Alleyne, decided to move into a one-bedroom apartment in Toronto’s Parkdale neighborhood. He recalls his mother giving him “the worst look anyone could ever have,” as he dragged his mattress out of their home. “She looked at me like she had failed,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/magazine/can-the-weeknd-turn-himself-into-the-biggest-pop-star-in-the-world.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The New York Times" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The New York Times</a> in 2015.

Eventually selling marijuana for a nominal amount of money, he and his roommates lived a “no rules” lifestyle and would get high on such drugs as MDMA, Xanax, cocaine, mushrooms and ketamine. (He also addressed this dark period of his life in his autobiographical 2020 song “Snowchild.”) They were eventually evicted, and The Weeknd admitted he’d tell various girls he loved them so he’d have a place to stay. “There was, like, three girls that thought legit that I was their boyfriend,’’ he explained to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/magazine/can-the-weeknd-turn-himself-into-the-biggest-pop-star-in-the-world.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="New York Times" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">New York Times</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In a 2016 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/dec/03/the-weeknd-abel-tesfaye-interview-music-tom-lamont data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Guardian" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Guardian</a>, The Weeknd admitted to also spending nights in jail when he was about 18, something he described as being bad enough for him to “smarten up, to focus.” He elaborated: “A lot of people don’t get that second chance. But around that age, you usually get one second chance after a slap on the wrist. And you either take the experience and think, ‘This is it, final straw’, or you don’t. And the next move after that? It’s your entire life. You become who you become because of the next move you make.”</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Drake helped launch his career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.xxlmag.com/history-drake-the-weeknd-relationship data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Drake initially introduced" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Drake initially introduced</a> the then-little-known singer to his fanbase in 2010 by posting two of the fellow Canadian artist’s songs on his October's Very Own blog.
