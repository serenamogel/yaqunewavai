An actor, comedian, and writer, David Cross became a household name appearing on the television series “Arrested Development”, and for his work on the sketch comedy, “Mr. Show”. He was born&nbsp;on April 4, 1964, in Atlanta, Georgia. Cross has been one of the key figures in pioneering alternative comedy&nbsp;since the late 1980s/early&nbsp;1990s. Honing his comic skills since he was 17, Cross first entered the limelight with his work on the sketch comedy TV series “Mr. Show with Bob and David” (HBO, 1995-98). He made a major breakthrough after&nbsp;playing Tobias Fünke on the influential television show “Arrested Development” (Fox, 2003-06). Both the innovative sketch comedy show and the half-hour sitcom, were&nbsp;adored by both&nbsp;critics and&nbsp;fans and earned Cross a loyal following among comedy and alternative pop culture audiences. He has managed to carve out a solid career away from the mainstream, with a Grammy-nominated stand-up album, voice-over work for far-out animated series like “Aqua Teen Hunger Force” (Adult Swim, 2000- ) and “Crank Yankers,” (Comedy Central, 2002-05; MTV2, 2007), as well as with his big screen character roles in the movies “I’m Not There” (2007) and “Year One” (2009). Being fiercely intelligent, opinionated and outspoken, David Cross has successfully worked on a wide array of projects.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fma63tcNmmquno6jAbrrErWSwp6KptW6uyKieq5mgncZussCcq2abkaeypr6Mmq6aqpSoeqK6w2ajop6VYsC1u9GyZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
