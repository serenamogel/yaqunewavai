Grammy-nominated rapper Lil Yachty launched his own frozen pizza brand called Yachty’s Pizzeria, and they just released their pizzas, in four dank-looking flavors, at Walmart.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-did-lil-yachty-feel-the-need-to-make-pizza-in-the-first-place>Why did Lil Yachty feel the need to make pizza in the first place?</h2><p>To answer that question with more questions, why not? Who says a great rapper can’t make a great pizza? Troy from High School Musical can <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sing and play basketball</a>, which means&nbsp;anyone&nbsp;can do&nbsp;anything (if I’m understanding the message of High School Musical correctly)! Lil Yachty has apparently been a big fan of making and eating pizza his whole life, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told Delish</a> that he is “extremely excited” about this project. “We made some wild flavors but there’s still something for everybody,” he added. “I take my pizza seriously so I’m looking forward to seeing what people think.” This dude seems to really have a thing for pizza! And who could blame him? Pizza is great!&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram">https://www.instagram.com/p/CiEIEybOeEU/?hl=en</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-so-what-are-the-dank-looking-flavors-of-lil-yachty-pizza>So…what are the dank-looking flavors of&nbsp;Lil Yachty Pizza?</h2><p>Well, those flavors are: Buffalo Style Chicken, Hot Honey Cheese, Pepperoni & Bacon, and Veggie Supreme. But these aren’t just regular ol’ pizzas. The Buffalo Style Chicken comes with french fried onions and a buffalo ranch sauce. The hot honey cheese flavor has a spicy tomato sauce with hot honey for sweetness. Seems like Lil Yachty put a lot of thought-y into this pizza line.</p><p>More exciting news: Lil Yachty’s pizza line is being produced by Deep Cuts, a pizza company that plans to offer “a line of premium frozen pizzas created by Universal Music Group for Brands.” This means Lil Yachty’s pizza may be the first in a series of fancy frozen pizzas released by music artists. I don’t know about you, but I really want the next one to be a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Butter</a> pizza from BTS. Oooh or a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Passionfruit</a> pizza by Drake. Oooooh OR a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pie by the Ocean</a> pizza from DNCE (spoiler alert: it’s seafood themed). Okay, I’ll stop.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKSZoXq6rcKhq7JloJ7Hu62Mp5ywq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
