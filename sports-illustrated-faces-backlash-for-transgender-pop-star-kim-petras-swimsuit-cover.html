Pop singer Kim Petras graced the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue — the second transgender woman to do so.
The publication is facing backlash from conservatives, who are calling for a boycott of the mag.
But many people clapped right back at anti-transgender remarks.
Petras’ cover is one of four for this year’s Swimsuit Issue, alongside Megan Fox, Brooks Nader and Martha Stewart."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

No matter what your gender or sexuality or any of that stuff is, it’s about what you make of life and it’s about what’s inside of you, so I hope that can be inspiring to people.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Petras and singer Sam Smith made history after winning at the Grammy Awards this year. <span class=credit>FilmMagic</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">Petras admitted it’s a “scary” time to be transgender in America. <span class=credit>Xavier Collin/Image Press Agency / MEGA</span></figure><p>Petras <a href=#>made history earlier in the year </a>at the 65th annual Grammy Awards, winning Best Pop Duo Performance with Sam Smith for their dance hit “Unholy.”</p><p>She was the first transgender woman to take home the award, and the second trans woman to win a Grammy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j25mam5fqL2wvtOsZKKknKrAtb7ArZydZZaWsKa%2FjJuYnKOclsCpecWoqWasopa7tLPEp5ueql2lvLF50q2Yq2WbnrpuvMStqZqrXajEqrnSrqCtZZOkw6a%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
