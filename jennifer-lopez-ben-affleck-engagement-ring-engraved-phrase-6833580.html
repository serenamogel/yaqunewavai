In a new interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Apple Music One's Zane Lowe</a>, Lopez revealed the sweet message engraved on her (second) engagement ring from Affleck, which serves as a constant reminder that they're in it for the long haul: "Not. Going. Anywhere."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The phrase was born after the now-husband-and-wife duo rekindled their romance. Lopez told Lowe that Affleck started using the three words, now etched into her ring, to let her know he was serious this time. "That's how he would sign his emails when we started talking again," she said. "Like, 'Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple tied the knot over the summer in two separate ceremonies: A chapel wedding in Las Vegas followed by a more <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>formal event</a> attended by friends and family at Affleck's Savannah, Georgia estate. They initially got engaged back in 2002 after meeting on the set of their infamous movie Gigli, but later split in 2004. Lopez shared that their love is even stronger and better now later in life. "Now, we know and there's no questions," she said. "It's me and you, all the way, 'til the end."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Last week, Lopez announced that she will be releasing a follow-up album to her 2002 record, This Is Me...Then, titled <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>This Is Me...Now</a>. Since the original piece of work was heavily influenced by her early aughts romance with Affleck, she wants to give fans a look into their love now — one of the tracks is even aptly named "Not. Going. Anywhere."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Twenty years ago, I fell in love with the love of my life. And I was working on an album, and it was all about capturing that moment in time," she told Lowe. "I said, 'Now the most amazing, incredible, unbelievable thing has happened, and the reason we're here is because I want to capture this moment in time 'cause it is even better than the first time.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yZ6lp6GWmr9uuM6pnLNlkpq7bq3Fn6Oem5tisq%2BzwKCcpp2eqXqztc2gZJ6ml6eut7HDZqehqpGosm6Cl2xqbnBg</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
