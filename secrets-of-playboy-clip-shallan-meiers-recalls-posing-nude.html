“Playboy was not my dream,” Shallan Meiers recalls in Us Weekly‘s exclusive clip from season 2 of Secrets of Playboy, premiering Monday, July 10, on A+E.
Meiers was working as a waitress at Spago in Las Vegas when a scout from Playboy approached her and asked whether her breasts were real."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She was one of seven semifinalists but lost to<strong> Lauren Anderson</strong>, who was Playmate of the Month in July of that year.</p><p>Anderson is also set to appear in season 2 of Secrets of Playboy, which will explore the aftermath of several women’s associations with the brand. Season 1, which featured <a href=#>interviews with Madison</a>, 43, and <a href=#><strong>Bridget Marquardt</strong></a>, aired last year.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Madison later said that it was <a href=#>difficult for her to watch</a> the docuseries after sharing her experience with its creators. “I watched all of them except episode two. I don’t want to watch myself talk about my trauma again,” she recalled during an August 2022 episode of <a href=#>her “Girls Next Level” podcast</a>. “I can’t take it. But every other episode, I watched — and it came out over the course of 12 weeks. I had nightmares after I watched them. I had a nightmare I was back at the mansion every single night after Secrets of Playboy.”</p><p>Secrets of Playboy season 2 premieres on A+E Monday, July 10, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqem6KawbR5zp9kqaSRrq%2BwxYyco6KoXai1orjLmqVmpZWesrO%2FjKucnJmcocBuvM6soKefXaPCpbGO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
