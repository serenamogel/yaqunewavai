Unlike some of the other bread and butter pickles we tried, these aren’t sickeningly sweet. They have the perfect balance of sugariness and sourness. In addition to those two base flavors, there are interesting notes of mustard seed and turmeric. These perfect pickles had me wanting to eat them from the jar by the fistful. Plus, they’re cheap! Who doesn’t love a delicious and affordable pickle?</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best bread and butter pickles" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BEST-BREAD-AND-BUTTER-PICKLES-RANKING_JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_02.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Most Interesting</p><strong>Mt. Olive Sweet Heat Bread & Butter Chips</strong><p>I love a little heat with my sweet, so these Mt. Olive Sweet Heat Bread & Butter Chips are perfect for me. I don’t typically expect complexity of flavor when it comes to sweet pickles, so these were a wonderful surprise. We debated in the office whether or not these were actually spicy, but we all agreed that they are definitely delicious, even if the heat may be a little toned down for some palates. These would be so good on a BBQ pulled pork sandwich or as an unexpected addition to a charcuterie plate. Try these if you’re looking for something a little different.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Intstacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best bread and butter pickles" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BEST-BREAD-AND-BUTTER-PICKLES-RANKING_JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_03.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Budget</p><strong>Market Pantry Bread & Butter Chips</strong><p>Market Pantry Bread & Butter Chips are a solid and tasty option if you’re looking for sweet pickles on the cheap. They’re thinner than some of the other chips we tried and reminded me of the pickles you get on a fast food burger or fried chicken sandwich. The taste is mild and there is a hint of celery seed. Grab a jar of these if you’re making burgers for a bunch of people and want to keep the cost in check.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="bread and butter pickles" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BEST-BREAD-AND-BUTTER-PICKLES-RANKING_JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_04.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best for Dill Lovers</p><strong>Bubbies Bread & Butter Chips</strong><p>Bubbies Bread & Butter Chips taste more like dill pickles than sweet pickles to me—but I’m not mad about it! I love a dill pickle and rarely find myself reaching for sweet pickles. This would be a great jar of pickles to buy if you live in a split household where some prefer dill and others prefer bread and butter. I also love that these chips are huge. Add these to a sandwich if you want it to have loads of pickle flavor.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best bread and butter pickles" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BEST-BREAD-AND-BUTTER-PICKLES-RANKING_JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_05.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Fresh</p><strong>Sonoma Brinery Fresh Bread & Butter Pickles</strong><p>I believe, in my heart of hearts, that pickles should come in a glass jar. It’s reusable, more sustainable, and just feels more pickle-y. Sonoma Brinery pickles unfortunately come in a plastic tub. I will give them a pass, though, because their Fresh Bread & Butter Pickles taste great. They’re super crunchy, very cucumbery, and not too sweet. These would be great for snacking because you could eat a whole plate full without getting sick of them. I also think these are one of the few sweet pickles that would be good paired with cheese. Get some Sonoma Brinery bread and butter pickles and a block of <a href=#>nice sharp cheddar</a> and you have yourself a little midnight snack plate!</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Intstacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other Products We Tried:</strong> Mt.
