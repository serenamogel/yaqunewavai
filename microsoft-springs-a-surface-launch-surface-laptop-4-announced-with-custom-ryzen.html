Perhaps no product has felt that more than the Microsoft Surface Laptop 3, especially the AMD version, which launched in late 2019. Based on AMD’s Picasso platform at the time, the AMD Ryzen Surface Edition processor suffered from poor battery life – an issue which AMD resolved with the launch of their Ryzen 4000 series “Renoir” processors just a few months later.</p><p>Today, Microsoft is rectifying this, but not going quite as far as you would expect for a device launching in April 2021. Once again, Microsoft will be launching both Intel and AMD powered versions of the Surface Laptop 4, and again, the AMD models will feature a custom Ryzen processor. However, despite AMD releasing their Ryzen 5000 series “Cezanne” lineup, the Surface Laptop 4 will feature the older Renoir platform. As disappointing as this is, Renoir was a very capable platform, with great performance, and great battery life. Perhaps the Surface Laptop 4 refresh was supposed to come in late 2020, but was delayed by Covid, but regardless, even with the Ryzen 4000 series powering it, the Surface Laptop 4 should be a big improvement over the Surface Laptop 3.</p><table align=center border=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=1 width=635><tbody border=1 readability=18.5><tr class=tgrey readability=2><td align=center colspan=8>Microsoft Surface Laptop 4</td></tr><tr class=tlblue><td width=86>&nbsp;</td><td align=center valign=middle width=268>13.5-Inch</td><td align=center valign=middle width=269>15-Inch</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=tlgrey>Processor</td><td align=center colspan=1 valign=middle>Intel Core i5-1035G7<p>Intel Core i5-1145G7</p><p>Intel Core i7-1185G7</p><p>AMD Ryzen 5 4680U</p><p>AMD Ryzen 7 4980U</p></td><td align=center valign=middle>Intel Core i7-1185G7<p>AMD Ryzen 7 4980U</p></td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=tlgrey>Memory</td><td align=center colspan=2 valign=middle>8GB/16GB/32GB LPDDR4X-3733MHz</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=tlgrey>Graphics</td><td align=center colspan=2 valign=middle>Intel: Intel Iris Xe Grahics<br>AMD: AMD Ryzen Microsoft Surface Edition Radeon Graphics</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=tlgrey>Display</td><td align=center valign=middle>13.5" 2256x1504 3:2 PixelSense<br>Touch and Pen support<br>Individually calibrated panels</td><td align=center colspan=2 valign=middle>15" 2496x1664 3:2 PixelSense<br>Touch and Pen support<br>Individually calibrated panels</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=tlgrey>Storage</td><td align=center colspan=2 valign=middle>256 GB, 512 GB PCIe NVMe<br>Removable Drive</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=tlgrey>Networking</td><td align=center colspan=2 valign=middle>Wi-Fi 6 802.11ax<br>Bluetooth 5.0</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=tlgrey>Audio</td><td align=center colspan=2 valign=middle>Omnisonic Speakers<br>Dolby Audio 9</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=tlgrey>Battery</td><td align=center colspan=1 valign=middle>Up to 19 hours on AMD Ryzen 5<br>Up to 17 hours on Intel Core i5</td><td align=center colspan=1 valign=middle>Up to 17.5 hours on AMD Ryzen 5<br>Up to 16.5 hours on Intel Core i5</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Right Side</td><td align=center colspan=2 valign=middle>Surface Connect Port</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=tlgrey>Left Side</td><td align=center colspan=2 valign=middle>USB Type-A<br>USB Type-C<br>Headset Jack</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=tlgrey>Dimensions</td><td align=center valign=middle>308 x 223 x 14.51 mm (12.1 x 8.8 x 0.57 inches)</td><td align=center colspan=1 valign=middle>339.5 x 244 x 14.69 mm (13.4 x 9.6 x 0.57 inches)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=tlgrey>Weight</td><td align=center valign=middle>Fabric: 1.26kg<br>Metal: 1.29kg</td><td align=center colspan=1 valign=middle>1.54kg</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=tlgrey>Camera</td><td align=center colspan=2 valign=middle>Front: 720p Camera and Windows Hello support<br>Dual far-field Studio Mics</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=tlgrey>Extras</td><td align=center colspan=2 valign=middle>Surface Pen and Dial (sold separately)<br>TPM 2.0</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Pricing</td><td align=center valign=middle>Starting at $999 USD</td><td align=center valign=middle>Starting at $1099 USD</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Perhaps disappointingly for AMD fans, customers who opt for the Intel-based Surface Laptop 4 will not have to suffer such indignities. Surface Laptop 4 will ship with the latest Intel Tiger Lake platform, which brings slightly updated CPU cores, and much more powerful Intel Xe graphics, on Intel’s 10 nm process.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/16613/SL4Consumer_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/16613/SL4Commercial_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Also good news is that Microsoft has drastically expanded the lineup in terms of choice, with both the 13.5-inch, and the 15-inch models both available with AMD or Intel options, whereas the AMD version was only available in the 15-inch for Surface Laptop 3, and the Intel Ice Lake was only available as the “Business” edition. For the Surface Laptop 4, there is plenty of choice.</p><p>Additional choices are now available in terms of color too, with Microsoft adding an Ice Blue option to the existing Platinum, Matte Black, and Sandstone options. One of the most unique aspects of the original Surface Laptop was the Alcantara keyboard deck, and Microsoft has kept that as an option for the 13.5-inch model in either Platinum or Ice Blue.</p><p>Microsoft is claiming up to 19 hours of battery life on the Surface Laptop 4, in 13.5-inch guise and with the AMD Ryzen processor. This is a significant upgrade over the outgoing model, and comes alongside much better performance. Memory is 8 GB to 32 GB, and storage is 256 GB to 1 TB. Microsoft used to be guilty of offering specifications that were too low for even a base model, but 8 GB / 256 GB is a reasonable low-end configuration.</p><p>Microsoft pushed back on USB Type-C, and the company still is pushing back on Thunderbolt, even on the Intel-based devices. Thunderbolt 4 brings a lot of standardization, and would have been nice to see, but sadly, the company refuses to support it. One area where they can be commended though is that they are expanding their removable SSD support to the Surface Laptop 4, allowing easier expandability in the future. The drives are, as far as we can tell, still PCIe 3.0 NVMe drives, even though the Intel Tiger Lake model would support PCIe 4.0 storage. We’ll try to get clarification on if the slot supports it or not though.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/16613/Surface%20Laptop%204%20Family_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The Surface Laptop has always offered great build quality, along with the fantastic PixelSense display in the now ubiquitous Surface 3:2 aspect ratio. While there are no major changes to the chassis, the updated internals, coupled with the light weight and good display, bring the Surface Laptop back into the equation.</p><p>The Surface Laptop 4 is available for pre-order, starting at $999 for the 13.5-inch, and $1099 for the 15-inch models.</p><p>Source: Microsoft</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH53gpBsZqahk6e8tLvFrWSsqKKeu6i%2FjJpkrK2im66ksYylmK6mk516tMHRn5icnV2hrrHAzqlkbWWRo7uwwc2cnJ1lp57BqXnCrqqtp51iv7rGxKc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
