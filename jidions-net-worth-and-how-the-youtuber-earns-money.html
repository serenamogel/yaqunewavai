Recommended Videos Some of YouTube’s biggest success stories — people like PewDiePie and Ryan Kaji — have already made millions off the platform, and their bank accounts are only growing. The overwhelming majority of YouTubers don’t make a cent off the site, of course, but those with their eyes on the prize sometimes come out with an enviable following, and even more enviable bank account."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The overwhelming majority of YouTubers don’t make a cent off the site, of course, but those with their eyes on the prize sometimes come out with an enviable following, and even more enviable bank account.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=812 data-injectable=true><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">JiDion</a></strong> is among the shortlist of financially successful YouTube creators. He’s moved past those early days of making cents for each of his videos, and on to making what was once a hobby into a full-time career. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">His YouTube page</a> boasts more than 7.8 million subscribers, and his videos have pulled in upwards of 678 million views in total. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">He’s a big deal</a>, over on the video-sharing site, and he has the net worth to prove it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>JiDion’s net worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/JiDion1.jpg><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=561 data-injectable=true>That net worth numbers as much as $1 million, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according</a> to numerous <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sources</a>. It could even stretch a bit higher, with some crediting the creator with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">closer to $4 million</a> in the bank, but between $1 and $2 million appears to be the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">more agreed upon</a> range.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=227 data-current-count=227 data-injectable=false>Those <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">numbers don’t quite compete</a> with Hollywood’s elite, but they’re certainly impressive for the rest of us. The majority of Americans won’t ever have $1 million in the bank, particularly not in their early 20s.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-jidion-built-his-wealth data-injectable=false>How JiDion built his wealth</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=527 data-injectable=true>https://youtu.be/5_0zxgnJ4M8?si=LWwIw2mDMRKG3qHi</figure><p data-characters=415 data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true>The majority of JiDion’s money comes from his work over on YouTube. He also leaned on Twitch uploads for a while, but a permanent ban in 2022 forced the creator to rely entirely on YouTube. It seems he deserved the Twitch ban, after spamming fellow streamer Pokimane during a raid, but it did limit his income potential somewhat. Not enough to bring his estimated net worth below $1 million, of course, but still.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WealthyGorilla</a>, JiDion makes approximately $1.21 per 1000 views on his videos. Considering the hundreds of millions of views on his page, its clear to see where the majority of his money comes from. He’s estimated to pull in around $21,000 a month, with some months serving him better than others.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=770 data-injectable=false>On his current trajectory, it seems likely that JiDion will break the $2 million mark in a few years — if not more than that. His videos tend to pull in a minimum of two to three million views, with many pulling much closer to 10 million. That’s a lot of views already, and his numbers are only likely to grow as his popularity does. Within a half decade, he might be giving those aforementioned Hollywood elite a run for their money — literally.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S3qrDIqKWsZZ6awW7DzquroWWRo7FutM6wZK2glWLGsMHTrpmeql2arrO60makqKaVrnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
