It comes in different formats as well, from 3D rendering through rasterization, such as games, or by ray tracing, and invokes the ability of the software to manage meshes, textures, collisions, aliasing, physics (in animations), and discarding unnecessary work. Most renderers offer CPU code paths, while a few use GPUs and select environments use FPGAs or dedicated ASICs. For big studios however, CPUs are still the hardware of choice.</p><p>All of our benchmark results can also be found in our benchmark engine, <a href=#>Bench</a>.</p><p><span>For our graphs, some of them have two values: a regular value in orange, and one in red called 'Intel Spec'. ASUS offers the option to 'open up' the power and current limits of the chip, so the CPU is still running at the same frequency but is not throttled. Despite Intel saying that they recommend 'Intel Spec', the system they sent to us to test was actually set up with the power limits opened up, and the results they provided for us to compare to internally also&nbsp;</span><span>correlated with that setting. As a result, we're providing&nbsp;</span><span>both sets results for our CPU tests</span><span>.</span></p><h3>Corona 1.3: Performance Render</h3><p>An advanced performance based renderer for software such as 3ds Max and Cinema 4D, the Corona benchmark renders a generated scene as a standard under its 1.3 software version. Normally the GUI implementation of the benchmark shows the scene being built, and allows the user to upload the result as a ‘time to complete’.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/13748/4-Corona_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>We got in contact with the developer who gave us a command line version of the benchmark that does a direct output of results. Rather than reporting time, we report the average number of rays per second across six runs, as the performance scaling of a result per unit time is typically visually easier to understand.</p><p>The Corona benchmark website can be found at <a href=#>https://corona-renderer.com/benchmark</a></p><p align=center><img alt="Corona 1.3 Benchmark" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph13748/105876.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>.</p><h3>Blender 2.79b: 3D Creation Suite</h3><p>A high profile rendering tool, Blender is open-source allowing for massive amounts of configurability, and is used by a number of high-profile animation studios worldwide. The organization recently released a Blender benchmark package, a couple of weeks after we had narrowed our Blender test for our new suite, however their test can take over an hour. For our results, we run one of the sub-tests in that suite through the command line - a standard ‘bmw27’ scene in CPU only mode, and measure the time to complete the render.</p><p>Blender can be downloaded at <a href=#>https://www.blender.org/download/</a></p><p align=center><img alt="Blender 2.79b bmw27_cpu Benchmark" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph13748/105877.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>.</p><h3>LuxMark v3.1: LuxRender via Different Code Paths</h3><p>As stated at the top, there are many different ways to process rendering data: CPU, GPU, Accelerator, and others. On top of that, there are many frameworks and APIs in which to program, depending on how the software will be used. LuxMark, a benchmark developed using the LuxRender engine, offers several different scenes and APIs.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/13748/5-Luxmark01_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><br>Taken from the Linux Version of LuxMark</p><p>In our test, we run the simple ‘Ball’ scene on both the C++ and OpenCL code paths, but in CPU mode. This scene starts with a rough render and slowly improves the quality over two minutes, giving a final result in what is essentially an average ‘kilorays per second’.</p><p align=center><img alt="LuxMark v3.1 C++" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph13748/105878.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>.</p><h3>POV-Ray 3.7.1: Ray Tracing</h3><p>The Persistence of Vision ray tracing engine is another well-known benchmarking tool, which was in a state of relative hibernation until AMD released its Zen processors, to which suddenly both Intel and AMD were submitting code to the main branch of the open source project. For our test, we use the built-in benchmark for all-cores, called from the command line.</p><p>POV-Ray can be downloaded from <a href=#>http://www.povray.org/</a></p><p align=center><img alt="POV-Ray 3.7.1 Benchmark" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph13748/105879.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH50g5NxZq2glWK2r8DEpWSxnZ%2Bjerh5kmpubrBdp7K3tcSwZGtwXaq7rbvCpJydZZOkv6a%2FjGtwcnFdqsCle5Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
