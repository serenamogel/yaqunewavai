The legendary wrestler recently made some assumptions about how far his career may have progressed if he hadn’t experienced concussion problems and a stroke.</p><p>The WWE Hall of Famer had his ring career cut short early in 2000. <a href=#>Hart suffered concussion in a WCW World Heavyweight Title</a> match against Goldberg at WCW Starrcade in 1999. He eventually engaged in eight more matches of wrestling before being compelled to hang up his boots.</p><p>While the former WWE Champion did compete in a few battles in 2010, his options were severely constrained. Hart revealed how long he believes his career would have lasted if he had been able to maintain his health during an autograph session at <a href=#>K&S Wrestlefest</a>.</p><p>If I had no issues with my concussion and stuff like that, and if I never had a stroke, I mean let’s just say I was healthy at my age, I’d go back. I would’ve taken it pretty serious. I would’ve wrestled a lot more over the last 10 years if I hadn’t been hurt. All the dream matches everyone talks about, I would’ve loved to have done all of them. Daniel Bryan, CM Punk, Roman Reigns, John Cena, Randy Orton.</p><p>Hart recently said that Kurt Angle, Brock Lesnar, and Rey Mysterio would have all been welcome in the ring with him. But it’s unlikely that Goldberg would have agreed to another round. Check out the interview below.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
