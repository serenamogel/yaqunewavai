Recommended Videos The rapper, actor, and key player in the infamous Fyre Festival scandal revealed in an interview with Insider that he was offered a major part in 2 Fast 2 Furious, but he turned it down because he didn’t feel signing on for the street racing sequel was a worthwhile financial investment on account of the money he was making on tour."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That’s okay. I’m fine with that. I’m Ja Rule, the amazing artist that has had an amazing career, an amazing songwriter. That’s who I am. That’s who people see me as. That’s who I want to be revered as.”</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=684 data-injectable=true>The part of Tej eventually went to Ludacris, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who has been a key component of The Fast Saga for two decades and counting</a>, whereas Ja Rule hasn’t released a studio album in over a decade after failing to sustain his early-to-mid 2000s fame in the long run. Even at that, he remains adamant he made the right call.</p><p>“I was probably the biggest artist in the rap game. I’ll propose this to you:&nbsp;I’m John Singleton. I’m gonna offer you $500,000 to shoot a movie for three months. Or I’m going on a tour and I’m gonna make close to $15 million in the span of less than two months.&nbsp;Well, what you doing? Who knew that there was going to be 10 of them? But even still, I would’ve had to do 10 movies to make that kind of money, or at least eight.”</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>Ja Rule’s loss proved to be Ludacris’ gain in a major way to undersell it somewhat, with at least one more Fast & Furious blockbuster still to come, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and the promises of even more spin-offs beyond that</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGnXaC7psOMrZ%2BarF2ptaa%2BxGaumqtdnLyqusZmq6hlkpp6cnyMqJ1mrJiaum62wGaprqSVYr%2BmtsScq56cXZuutMCMn6yroZ%2BqwG67zaWwZqyfYrKvsIyup2avmam1brLYq5xmnpWowarCwKVm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
