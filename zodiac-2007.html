Its most impressive accomplishment is to gather a bewildering labyrinth of facts and suspicions over a period of years, and make the journey through this maze frightening and suspenseful. I could imagine becoming hopelessly mired in the details of the Zodiac investigation, but director <a href=#>David Fincher</a> ("<a href=#>Seven</a>") and his writer, <a href=#>James Vanderbilt</a>, find their way with clarity through the murk. In a film with so many characters, the casting by Laray Mayfield is also crucial; like the only eyewitness in the case, we remember a face once we've seen it.</p><p>The film opens with a sudden, brutal, bloody killing, followed by others not too long after -- five killings the police feel sure Zodiac committed, although others have been attributed to him. But this film will not be a bloodbath. The killer does his work in the earlier scenes of the film, and then, when he starts sending encrypted letters to newspapers, the police and reporters try to do theirs.</p><p>The two lead inspectors on the case are David Toschi (<a href=#>Mark Ruffalo</a>) and William Armstrong (<a href=#>Anthony Edwards</a>). Toschi, famous at the time, tutored <a href=#>Steve McQueen</a> for "<a href=#>Bullitt</a>" and was the role model for Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry. Ruffalo plays him not as a hotshot but as a dogged officer who does things by the book because he believes in the book. Edwards' character, his partner, is more personally worn down by the sheer vicious nature of the killer and his taunts.</p><p>At the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, although we meet several staffers, the key players are ace reporter Paul Avery (<a href=#>Robert Downey</a> Jr., bearded, chain-smoking, alcoholic) and editorial cartoonist <a href=#>Robert Graysmith</a> (<a href=#>Jake Gyllenhaal</a>). These characters are real, and indeed the film is based on Graysmith's books about the case.</p><p>I found the newspaper office intriguing in its accuracy. For one thing, it is usually fairly empty, and it was true on a morning paper in those days that the office began to heat up closer to deadline Among the few early arrivals would have been the cartoonist, who was expected to work up a few ideas for presentation at the daily news meeting, and the office alcoholics, perhaps up all night, or already starting their recovery drinking. Yes, reporters drank at their desks 40 years ago, and smoked and smoked and smoked.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46zpp2hkZh6c3yPcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
