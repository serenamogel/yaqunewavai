Viserys seems unwilling to forget the memory of his newly deceased wife, but soon enough, he marries Alicent, and she becomes queen. Later in the season, ten years have passed with Rhaenyra having married and given three sons to Laenor Velaryon (John Macmillan), son of Corlys Velaryon from one of the oldest houses in the realm. Despite this, Alicent begins to ponder over the children’s true lineage, sparking further drama that aids in the ultimate unraveling of the characters we have begun to get to know.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s3.amazonaws.com/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/62fe8596b8b50d37e07d28c6/content_rhys-ifans.jpg><p>It’s not all plotting and scheming though as character arcs and relationships are integral to the plot of “House of the Dragon.” Daemon and Rhaenyra are definitely the standout characters and they have the most interesting arcs. As uncle and niece grow farther away from each other, their paths begin to mirror. Matt Smith's screen presence is otherworldly, playing Daemon with an at times unwavering arrogance, only truly revealing an inner turmoil through his eyes. Milly Alcock is fantastic as a young Rhaenyra Targaryen, as is Emily Carey as a young Alicent Hightower, but it is Emma D’Arcy and <a href=#>Olivia Cooke</a> who immediately stand out as their older counterparts in episode six.</p><p>Despite the initial apprehension, “House of the Dragon” has succeeded at being a true adaptation of George R.R. Martin’s work. The scale has been peeled back, abandoning long battle sequences for biting words, political intrigue, and character drama. It may take viewers who enjoyed the spectacle of later seasons of “Game of Thrones” a while to get on board, but fans of Martin’s books and the lore of Westeros are in for a treat.&nbsp;</p><p>It seems a simple premise, one where mischief and tyranny rule over the lords of the seven kingdoms, but this show is anything but simple. “House of the Dragon” immediately breathes new life into the world of ice and fire, proving that when done with care, adaptations of this rich world can still be enthralling.</p><p>Six episodes screened for review.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmrKyimq6utc2gZqGnpaiybrvFZquhnV2Zv6Kzzqdkra5dp7K3tcSwZGtoYmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
