I'm looking down and our eyes meet," she told Eyewitness News Anchor Stephanie Maxwell.</p><p>She ran out the door after saying a few choice words, and the man ran out, too. Shortly afterward, an assistant manager called 911.</p><p>"He was so quiet," Rebecca said. "For him to get to where he was, he had to take steps. I had to take steps to get to my stall. For me not to hear a single footstep was creepy."</p><p>&nbsp;"(It's) been several years since we've had anything like this that I'm aware of," Gastonia Police Sgt. Heath McMullan said. "It's just good not to go into a restroom alone."</p><p>Rebecca saw the suspect's face and arms. She thinks he might be Hispanic or maybe European. She said she knows exactly what she would say to the man if he is caught.</p><p>"(I'd ask) why he's such a sick person. Ask him, 'Do you want help?' He needs help," Rebecca said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph body-copyright">WSOC</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL%2FOnKuvZpOkunC6xLCqaKSfmK6te9aopJqmXZi8r7LRqKWtq12lsqa8yKeeZqyfonqpu86tnKurX2p%2FcoOTcm9tZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
