&#34;Dinner in America,&#34; written, directed, and edited by Adam Rehmeier, is a movie with anti-establishment anti-social quicksilver coursing through its veins, but at its heart it is a sweet love story, one of the sweetest in recent memory. Sometimes a movie comes along and surprises you. Sometimes a movie makes a poor first impression but on closer examination you realize there's more there than meets the eye."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In cases such as this, I love being wrong.</p><p>"Dinner in America," written, directed, and edited by <a href=#>Adam Rehmeier</a>, is a movie with anti-establishment anti-social quicksilver coursing through its veins, but at its heart it is a sweet love story, one of the sweetest in recent memory. Sometimes a movie comes along and surprises you. Sometimes a movie makes a poor first impression but on closer examination you realize there's more there than meets the eye. (I have always admired Roger Ebert's transparent review of "<a href=#>The King of Comedy</a>," since it's as much about how he struggled with the movie, and resisted it, but came back to it, hoping to see it in a deeper way). To contradict <a href=#>Allen Ginsberg</a>, "First thought" isn't necessarily always "best thought." By the end of "Dinner in America," I looked back on my initial resistance with a small sense of awe.</p><p>Simon (<a href=#>Kyle Gallner</a>) is the aforementioned "pyro," a drifter and bad-boy. He is Middle America's worst nightmare, as the opening sequence shows. He has no respect for anything or anyone. "<a href=#>Blue Velvet</a>" portrayed the beautiful outward face of suburbia. All those flowers and sprinklers and perfect blue skies. "Dinner in America" sees no beauty in any of it. There's a scene where Simon stalks across a vacant lot, all cracked concrete with weeds bursting through, while in the background looms a giant glass office building. The contrast is stark, and says so much. Burn it all down.</p><p>After rampaging his way through one random family, he meets 20-year-old college dropout Patty (<a href=#>Emily Skeggs</a>), whom we have already seen at home with her awful parents (<a href=#>Pat Healy</a> and <a href=#>Mary Lynn Rajskub</a>), who treat her like she's a tween. Patty works in a pet store, and suffers constant harassment from two boys in track suits, who taunt her with sexual insults, and repeatedly call her a "retard." (The language is pretty rough throughout, and a tad heavy-handed.) Patty is awkward, lonely, and in a state of arrested development. She secretly loves the punk rock band Psy Ops, and she calls the lead singer, a mystery man named "John Q. Public," her "music boyfriend." Patty has never had a boyfriend, music or otherwise.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46doKemlad6qrqMmqSeqpmYrm65zq%2BgnmWimsOqsdZmaWlqYg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
