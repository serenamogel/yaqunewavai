Then as a lithe and spirited teenager, she falls into the clutches of two con men named Dimitri (<a href=#>John Cusack</a>) and Vladimir (Kelsey Grammer). They both worked in the royal court and have insider knowledge; their scheme is to tutor an imposter until she can fool the Dowager Empress. The irony, which the movie makes much of, is that this impostor is, in fact, the real thing.</p><p>“Anastasia” tells this story within what has become the almost rigid formula of the modern animated feature: The heroine and the hero both have sidekicks, the villain commands nasty little minions, and romance blooms, but doesn't get too soppy.</p><p>Much depends on how colorful the villain is, and the mad monk Rasputin (<a href=#>Christopher Lloyd</a>) is one of the best cartoon villains in a long time. The real Rasputin became infamous for taking so long to die--he was almost unkillable--and in this movie version he likewise lingers between life and death. His spirit burns on, but his body parts have a disconcerting habit of falling off. His little sidekick Bartok, an albino bat voiced by Hank Azaria, tirelessly screws missing limbs back into place.</p><p>Anastasia has a friend, too: Her little dog Pooka, who faithfully tags along. Indeed, every important character is assigned a sidekick; Dimitri has Vladimir, and the Dowager Empress has her faithful lady-in-waiting, Sophie (<a href=#>Bernadette Peters</a>). By the movie's end, Dimitri wins Anastasia, Vladimir wins Sophie, and I guess we can be relieved that the filmmakers spared us the Bartok-Pooka nuptials.</p><p>The film was produced and directed by former Disney artists Don Bluth and <a href=#>Gary Goldman</a>, whose credits include “<a href=#>The Land Before Time</a>” and “An American Tail.” Here they consciously include the three key ingredients in the big Disney hits: action, romance and music. Only the songs disappoint. (Why didn't they do the obvious, and license the title song from the 1956 film?) There are three big action sequences: A storm at sea, as Anastasia sleepwalks perilously close to the briny deep; a runaway locomotive and a wreck, as Rasputin's little green goblins sabotage the train carrying Anastasia to Paris, and a final showdown between Rasputin and the forces of good. The action here is alive and energetic, and the train sequence is genuinely thrilling.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46apZqrpJbAqq2ManBybw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
