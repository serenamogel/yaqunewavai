They honed their communal craft in the church choir where the goal was to blend rather than showboat. You can hear the gospel-bred tradition of call-and-response from the samples of their work on the film's vibrant soundtrack, from Ray Charles' "What I'd Say" and girl-group-era "He's a Rebel" to Donna Summers' "<a href=#>Bad Girls</a>" and <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a>'s "Thriller."</p><p>But as uplifting as the music is, the film most benefits from the participants' abundant gifts as storytellers. They provide funny, frank and unabashedly emotional first-hand accounts of what it is like to be a supporting player to some of the greats in the business. Neville also convinced an impressive number of insightful icons to sing the praises of those hired to enhance their performance with little recognition, including <a href=#>Bruce Springsteen</a>, <a href=#>Stevie Wonder</a>, <a href=#>Bette Midler</a>, Sting and <a href=#>Mick Jagger</a>, whose camera-ready charm stands in stark contrast to the honest and raw presence of the movie's less lauded subjects.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v45rZ2aelZrBbrLRqKRmq6SWv6W7zGZpaWlj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
