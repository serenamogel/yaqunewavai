But who could the British actor be up for in the film? Well, fans have put their heads together and come up with a few options so far.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=375 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>One is Gorr the God Butcher, a fearsome enemy of the Asgardian Avenger’s from the comics. And to help us imagine how Bale could look as the villain, Reddit user Ozycon has shared some fan art that casts the star as Gorr, complete with creepy head tentacles. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital artist BossLogic</a>, meanwhile, also posted a design of the actor but in this case, he went with Mephisto.</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=734 data-injectable=true>While we haven’t heard anything about Mephisto showing up in the sequel, Gorr has been linked to&nbsp;Love and Thunder&nbsp;in the past, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">We Got This Covered’s own sources</a> pointing to him featuring as a supporting antagonist a few months ago. However, as said above, there are a couple of other contenders in the running for Bale’s role as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Thor-.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Thor-Boss-Logic.jpeg><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>One is Beta Ray Bill, the horse-faced friend of Thor’s who fans have been waiting to see in the MCU for a long time now. He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly made it into</a> Ragnarok before being removed, so there’s a high chance he could pop up here. On the other hand, Bale could also be up for the part of Dario Agger, the CEO of evil corporation Roxxon – which has appeared in the MCU many times over the years – who can transform into a minotaur.</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>Bale’s actually the spitting image of the comic book character, too, and what’s more, comic writer – and Agger’s creator – <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Aaron believes this is the star’s role</a> in the movie. And given that Aaron’s run is a huge influence on <strong>Thor: Love and Thunder</strong>, he may be onto something.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GnomK5sMLEZquhrZ6ZsrN5xZqlZpmiqXqkrdKtqmabmKe2tMDImqVmmpGhsm6zzqupZp%2BfmXqjwdOcn56qXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
