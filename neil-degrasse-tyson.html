The $210 million project was completed in 2000, and the revamped site offered visitors a cutting-edge look at astronomy. One of Tyson's most controversial decisions at the time was the removal of Pluto from the display of planets. He classified Pluto as a dwarf planet, which invoked a strong response from some visitors. While some asked for the planet Pluto back, the International Astronomical Union followed Tyson's lead in 2006. The organization officially labeled Pluto as a dwarf planet.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Host of 'NOVA ScienceNow'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition to his work at the planetarium, Tyson has found other ways of improving the nation's scientific literacy.
