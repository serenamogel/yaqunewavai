This led to a chain of events where Napoleon defeated Britain and the British royal family fled to North America to set up the Britannian Empire. Japan was conquered by the Empire and turned into Area 11 (its citizens grimly referred to as “elevens”).</p><p data-characters=415 data-current-count=768 data-injectable=true>Knightmare Frames are the tools of conquest in Code Geass. They are the terrifying battle mechs that unleash death and destruction on the Empire’s enemies. Their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">origins</a> date back to earlier battles when emergency survival cockpits would detach from main battle tanks to preserve their crews in the event the tank was destroyed. These cockpits were built with artificial legs to run away from the battlefield.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>Eventually, some bright spark realized that fixing weapons to robotic legs would make a neat killing machine, and Knightmare Frames were born. The first mass-produced frame, the RPI-11 Glasgow, was so successful in the Britannian invasion of Japan that every other superpower on Earth began to copy the design.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=533 data-injectable=false>Next came the RPI-13 Sutherland, a frame that Lelouch uses in his quest to win back the Empire. The destructive potential of Knightmare Frames in Code Geass led them to become the most important weapon deployed by any army.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn5qsXZa%2FpnnKp6CgoKSirrOxjJ%2BpmqWVqHqquoycpp2dXZyyor%2FSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
