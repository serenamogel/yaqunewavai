As she explained in an interview with the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Boston Globe</a>,&nbsp;she was just 12 years old when the self-described procrastinator found herself in a conundrum, realizing she'd forgotten to buy a Mother's Day gift for her mom, Carla Ballerini. "I forgot it was Mother's Day the next day, and I knew that my mom loved what she calls 'gifts of the heart' — you know, things that are just really sweet," she explained. "I was like, 'Oh, I'll just write her a song.' That was the beginning of the end for me."</p><p>As Ballerini recalled for&nbsp;<a href=#>USA Today</a>, she titled the song "Oh Mama,"&nbsp;revealing that her mother "loved it — she cried." In fact, the youngster's song went over so well that she went back to that same well for future Mother's Day gifts. "For a while, I would write her another verse every Mother's Day," Ballerini recalled.</p><p>All those years later, Ballerini remains close with her mother, even taking her with her as her date to the 2017 Grammy Awards. "The best accessory I&nbsp;have is my mother,"&nbsp;Ballerini told <a href=#>People</a>, recalling how they watched the Grammys together when she was 13, promising, "Hey mom, if I&nbsp;ever get to go you're my date!" According to Ballerini, her mother had not forgotten that invitation when Ballerini was <a href=#>nominated</a> for Best New Artist that year. "She was like, 'Hey ...'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWljbIZ5e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5yp6jrJ2RYq%2BiuMueqaKmmWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
