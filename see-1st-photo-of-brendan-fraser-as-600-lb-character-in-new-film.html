This is certainly far removed from anything I’ve ever done. … I do know it’s going to make a lasting impression."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This is certainly far removed from anything I’ve ever done. … I do know it’s going to make a lasting impression.”</p><p>A first photo from the film shared via <a href=# rel=noopener>A24’s official Twitter account</a> shows the Mummy actor in character as Charlie. The Whale will premiere at the 79th Venice Film Festival later this summer.</p><p>Stranger Things’ <a href=#><strong>Sadie Sink</strong></a> plays Fraser’s estranged teenage daughter, Ellie in the psychological drama. The 20-year-old actress talked about the movie during a June interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Collider</a>.</p><p>“It was a really small cast and a small set, and we had a whole three weeks of rehearsal and Darren kind of wanted to treat it as if it were a play, because The Whale originally was a play. The way he staged it and the way we rehearsed it, the same as you would do in a theater company, he taped the walls of the set and everything so that we could rehearse in a mock space I guess,” she told the outlet.</p><p>The Fear Street Trilogy star added that the Aronofsky drama was “just a really creatively fulfilling project to work on.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/See-1st-Photo-Brendan-Fraser-600-Lb-Character-0001.jpg><p>The Whale is the latest film to stir up controversy regarding actors wearing fat suits. After the project was announced in January 2021, author and podcaster <strong>Aubrey Gordon</strong> shared the announcement via Twitter, writing, “It is so disheartening, exhausting and profoundly isolating to see this concept created over & over & over again, and reliably created by people who aren’t fat. Fellow fats (people who currently wear plus sizes): how are you feeling?”</p><p>In March, <a href=#><strong>Renée Zelwegger</strong></a> defended her <a href=#>decision to wear a fat suit</a> for her TV series The Thing About Pam.</p><p>“The idea is accuracy,” the 53-year-old Oscar winner, who plays real-life convicted murderer <strong>Pam Hupp</strong> in the show, told Entertainment Tonight. “I think, especially in the case of telling this story, it was really important to <a href=#>as closely resemble Pam Hupp</a> as we possibly could, because she seems so familiar. She seems like someone that we recognize and we know.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>However, not all actors who’ve played plus-sized characters feel confident in their decisions after further reflection. <a href=#><strong>Sarah Paulson</strong></a> admitted to having regrets about <a href=#>wearing a body prosthetic to portray Linda Tripp</a> in Impeachment: American Crime Story.</p><p>“I think the thing I think about the most is that I regret not thinking about it more fully. And that is an important thing for me to think about and reflect on,” the <a href=#>American Horror Story star</a>, who also gained 30 pounds for the role, told the Los Angeles Times in August 2021. “I also know it’s a privileged place to be sitting and thinking about it and reflecting on it, having already gotten to do it, and having had an opportunity that someone else didn’t have. You can only learn what you learn when you learn it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqenV1mwLV5z6GmraddpLNurtGepZ2ZnmKzs63SnqlmmaNig3F8jKWZZpuYlr%2Bir9OeqWahnmK7psOMn6ClpV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
