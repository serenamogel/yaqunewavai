Anders Clements, who was 66 years old and lived at 42 O’Donald Road, passed away at the Care Partners Hospice Center on Friday, July 21, 2023. He had the opportunity to spend time with the Lord. Immediately after the conclusion of the services in the church, the family will host a reception for their friends. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions can be donated to the West Buncombe Elementary School PTA, for the Hugs & Kisses Fund, or to a member of the Mt. Carmel Baptist Church who is also someone who has spent their entire life in Buncombe County.</p><p>Her parents, Fred Baxter Anders and Billie Lunsford Anders, had also passed away before her at the time of her passing. She is survived by her husband of 31 years, Gibson “Gib” Strother Clements, who resides at the family home; her children, Kelly Silvers (Jacob) of Van Buren, Arkansas, Erin Michelle Morrow (Rick Pigeon) of Stanley, and Tyler Gibson Clements of Asheville; and her grandsons, Zebulon Silvers, Jaxson Silvers, and Jayce Pigeon.</p><p>It has been determined that Kim Clements has passed away. Mrs. Clements taught kindergarten at West Buncombe Elementary School for a combined total of 21 years, during which time she earned her bachelor’s degree from Mars Hill College and her master’s degree in education from Western Carolina University. Both institutions are located in the state of North Carolina. Both schools awarded her a diploma upon completion of her studies there.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwt8imZJyklaKyr8DSZqaboaSqrrPFjJqqoZ2mnrmtsYynmmaklZa%2Fr3nMqKmeZZGXvLbAjKSgpmWTobKusc2tqmaclZbBqXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
