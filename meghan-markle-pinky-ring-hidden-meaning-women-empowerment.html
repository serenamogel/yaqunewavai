Shilpa Yarlagadda, the brand's founder and CEO, recently shared the jewelry's hidden message with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>People</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Markle sported the company's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener">1972 Tennis Pinky Ring</a>, which celebrates 50 years since Title IX gave women the rights to play school sports, and 19.72% of proceeds go to Women in Sports investment fund.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Pay parity and equal pay is still a huge issue in sports," Yarlagadda said. "Tennis is one of the few sports that has equal prize money for women, which is why we are calling this the 1972 Tennis Pinky Ring."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also wore another one of the brand's symbolic pieces on the cover of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Time</a> last year, where she posed alongside her husband <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Prince Harry</a>. The Duet Pinky Ring has a small diamond accompanied by a bigger one to symbolize women supporting other women through a "pinky promise," according to People.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Everything she does is with intention, thought and meaning behind the impact that she could have," Yarlagadda told the outlet. "I know that when she's wearing a piece of jewelry, there's a lot of intention behind it. We both care so much about empowering women and she's a fellow female founder with what she's built, too."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meghan's go-to jeweler has dedicated 50% of its profits to invest in female founders and other companies that support women. Yarlagadda noted that the brand has funded 11 female-founded companies so far.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think in many ways, Meghan and so many of these incredible women that have worn our rings really inspired me to create Shiffon because when I was young, I didn't really know what I could do," she said. "In high school and growing up in Silicon Valley, which is where I'm from, and especially in Palo Alto, we never saw that many female founders, that many female investors. The original pinky ring was designed to represent a pinky promise, to pay it forward, to support women."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8yenqGZnmK6or7KpZxopZWctaK6jKaYq6Ocmnqxtc2ksGaqmaO0brTInZuepl2isqK6yKeeZq%2BforKvecSmp6ivlae6prrT</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
