Four friends (Robbie, Scott, Angela, and Michelle) go deep into the Mojave to film a music video. They set up camp, but after night falls things take a disturbing turn when the friends hear a loud, discordant sound coming nearer and nearer the camp."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It's a pathetic 'wannabe every genre' movie while ending up as completely nothing. Found footage, horror, slasher movie, Sci-Fi, it's all here AND THE FILMMAKERS DO NOTHING WITH ANY OF IT. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4osQqVJmmJ</a></p>‚Äî The Art of Visual Storytelling (@TheArtofVisual1) <a href=#>February 15, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=99 data-current-count=99 data-injectable=false>With there being no clear answer as to what the ending truly means, there have been many theories.</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>On the surface, it seems the ending is Robbie somehow traveling between dimensions. Delving deeper, it is likely Robbie has descended into madness and is the one responsible for brutally murdering his friends.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>His final, violent self-mutilation is theorized to be an attempt to properly atone for the guilt of his crime. But in a wider sense, the film might be dealing with the insignificance of humanity and poses some serious questions about the value of human life in an infinite cosmos.</p><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=232 data-injectable=false>It also seems to be touching on the idea that the group‚Äôs doom was inevitable from the beginning. This might be serving as a comment on fate and how there is more going on in the universe than we can even begin to understand.</p><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=501 data-injectable=true>Or maybe The Outwaters is just trying to appeal to art film critics by being as intentionally indecipherable as possible.
