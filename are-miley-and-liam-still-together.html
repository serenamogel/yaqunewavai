I’ve learned from every situation in my life. I’m not perfect, I don’t want to be, it’s dull.</p><p>I’ve grown up in front of you, but the basic truth is, I Have Grown Up. I can admit to a lot of things but I refuse to acknowledge that my marriage ended due to adultery. Liam and I have been together for a decade. I’ve stated it before & it is still true, I adore Liam and always will.”</p><p>They formalized their divorce in January 2020. While Hemsworth has been dating Gabriella Brooks since late 2019, Cyrus has been seeing Maxx Morando since late 2021.</p><p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>For what reason did Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth split up?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/liam-hemsworth-and-miley-cyrus-attend-the-2019-met-gala-news-photo-1147423575-1566463796.jpg alt="Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth" width=1024 height=683 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>So why did Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth break up? Their union was troubled for a number of reasons. The “Midnight Sky” singer discussed her business and personal life on an episode of The Howard Stern Show airing on Wednesday, December 2, 2020.</p><p>Cyrus, who had just released her seventh studio album Plastic Hearts the week before, said to Howard Stern that she and Hemsworth split up in 2019 for no other reason than “there was too much strife.” She added, “When I return home, I want to feel grounded by someone. “I’m not into drama or arguments.”</p><p>Intensely emotional people like myself are less likely to ponder “What may be intentional about this?” She shared with Stern, “I simply clung to what was left of that house, which was myself and him.” And I loved him very, very, very, very much, and I do and did and always will.</p><p>She also told Stern that she had no idea she could marry Hemsworth. She said that the couple had been dating since they were both 16 years old. The fire destroyed our home.</p><p>I don’t know if we were ever seriously considering getting married, but we were engaged when we lost our Malibu home in a fire; my voice sounds considerably different before and after the fire. My animals were chained to a pole on the seashore and I was stuck in South Africa. “It’s all gone.</p><p>An insider previously told ET that Hemsworth isn’t disturbed by Miley’s Howard Stern to talk about him and is instead focused on his romance with model Gabriella Brooks. Liam Hemsworth isn’t hurt by Miley Cyrus’ latest interview in which she discusses the difficulties of their marriage.</p><p>“Liam was devastated by the breakup at the time, but he’s gotten over it and is quite content in his relationship with Gabriella,” the insider revealed. Gabriella is highly compatible with him and his conservative family because she shares his identical ideals.</p><p>They get along well since they came from comparable families and have similar experiences. After being married in 2018, Cyrus and Hemsworth confirmed their breakup in early 2019. They had a rocky on-and-off romance after meeting on the set of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Nicholas Sparks’s</a> The Last Song.</p><p>They called off their engagement and split up in 2012, only to be engaged again in 2017. After her initial audition with Hemsworth, Cyrus told Seventeen in 2009 that she was put off by his demeanor. Not until she got to know him did she realize how much she cared for him.</p><p>According to Cyrus, “there was talk that he didn’t really want the role.” And when he walked in to audition, I thought, ‘Here’s this man, he’s unbelievably good-looking, very confident, and he doesn’t realize how privileged he is to be in this room, because I know how blessed I am.</p><p>You and I can’t imagine a better chance than this. Ugh, nasty, I thought. Among the many low points in the couple’s history is the devastation of their Malibu house by California wildfires at the end of 2018. Both Cyrus and the Hunger Games actress, now 30 years old, “lost everything,” as Cyrus told Stern.</p><p>She said the fire in Malibu “done what I couldn’t do myself” in an interview with Rolling Stone in 2020. She told the magazine that being untethered “separated me from what no longer was performing its function.” You panic and grab for a life preserver as you sink.</p><p>This is what I think getting married meant for me, eventually. The last ditch effort to preserve my own skin. Cyrus shot back at speculation regarding the cause of her split with Hemsworth in September of 2020.</p><p>She revealed on an edition of the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Joe Rogan</a> Experience podcast, “I recently just gone through a very public divorce that f—ing sucked.” What truly sucked wasn’t the fact that I and somebody I loved realized that we don’t love each other as we used to. No worries there. That’s OK with me.</p><p>She went on, saying, “I can’t accept the villainizing and all of those tales,” referring to the media’s impression that she rapidly moved on with friend Kaitlynn Carter and, subsequently, ex-boyfriend Cody Simpson.</p><p>Us Weekly said on Saturday, August 15, 2019, that a source close to the Hunger Games actor said he had sought support from his family, particularly his brothers Chris and Luke Hemsworth, following his breakup with the former Disney Channel actress.</p><p>An source revealed, “[He] has got the support of his family to help him move on.” It’s a tragedy to him and his family that some details of his and Miley’s relationship have been made public, but Liam has been trying to be as quiet and polite as possible regarding their relationship and separation.</p><p>He’s a nice, old-fashioned person who took it hard when some things didn’t go his way in the public eye. When a couple proposed to her during her performance as the festival’s headliner at <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Lollapalooza</a> Brazil, she joked about it.</p><p>Once the proposal was accepted, she yelled, “Yasss!” to the delighted pair. Until the end of time, yasss! Congratulations! Baby, I pray your marriage is more successful than mine was. My attempt was a total failure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq5qoppyeu6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiZopp6rrXLnrBmmZ6Zeq21wKZkrKyZobluwM6gnK2glad8coOWb2lo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
