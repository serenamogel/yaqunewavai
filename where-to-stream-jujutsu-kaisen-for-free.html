Is It Available On Netflix , Hulu Or Crunchyroll?</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-01-31</div><p>Yuji Itadori, a high school student, inherits the power of Sukuna Ryomen, the king of curses, after consuming his cursed fingers to protect his classmates in ‘Jujutsu Kaisen.’ Unfortunately, he then becomes the demon’s host and is forced to face the burden of responsibility that no one else can. ‘Jujutsu Kaisen,’ based on the Japanese manga by Gege Akutami, introduces readers to the mysterious realm of demons, cursed energy, and a lot of action. Are you curious about the gripping plot of ‘Jujutsu Kaisen’ and where you can watch it online? You’ve come to the correct place; everything you need to know is right here.</p><h3>What is Jujutsu Kaisen About?</h3><p>Yuji Itadori is a caring high school student who, despite his natural athletic ability, prefers to join the Occult Research Club over the track team because of the autonomy it provides. His grandfather, who is on his deathbed, is also a major influence on his decision. He likes to pay him a visit whenever he has the opportunity. Before he dies, he teaches Yuji important lessons that he remembers. When the sorceress Megumi Fushiguro warns him that he has come into contact with a cursed charm talisman, his world is turned upside down.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/jujutsu-kaisen-2.jpg alt width=1024 height=536 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Yuji ends up swallowing the cursed Sukuna fingers to protect others, and the situation quickly spirals out of control. Because the sorcerers are afraid that Sukuna may take over his body, he is sentenced to death, but the sorcerers postpone his execution because Yuji looks to be in charge. They decide that before they kill Sukuna, Yuji must eat all of Sukuna’s fingers. As he inherits Sukuna Ryomen’s extraordinary talents, the high schooler suddenly finds himself in the chaotic world of cursed fingers and demons.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ua6cd990793f14d30ec455f01df217f7a><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Where I Can Watch Jujutsu Kaisen 0 | Is It on Netflix, Funimation Crunchyroll, or Hulu?</span></a><h3>Is Jujutsu Kaisen on Netflix?</h3><p>Unfortunately, ‘Jujutsu Kaisen’ is not now available to watch on Netflix.
