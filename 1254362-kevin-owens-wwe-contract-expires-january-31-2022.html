Last week, Fightful Select reported Kevin Owens’ WWE contract is set to expire in January 2022, which was much earlier than it was believed to run out. Now, both the Wrestling Observer Newsletter and Fightful Select have confirmed Owens’ deal runs out on January 31, 2022.
The specific date is notable because it would indicate that if he does not re-sign with the company, Owens is also in jeopardy of missing the Royal Rumble event."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The Rumble is typically an event held in January, but Fightful Select also recently reported that WWE is actually targeting early February as a possible date for the PPV. (It’s worth noting that WWE has already confirmed its <a href=# rel=noopener>“Day 1” pay-per-view event in Atlanta</a>&nbsp;will take place on New Year’s Day, so there will still be a January event no matter when the Rumble takes place.) Additionally, <a href=# rel=noopener>Fightful</a> also reported St. Louis is considered to be a front-runner to host the Royal Rumble, but plans are not set in stone for the host city yet.</p><p>Owens took part in a 2018 interview and said that he’d signed a new five-year contract, which would have taken him through 2023. Fightful’s Sean Ross Sapp explained that&nbsp;WWE restructured multiple contracts before the pandemic, and the end date of Owens’ deal was affected. It’s unknown why this change was made, but Sapp once again clarified that the deals were renegotiated ahead of the pandemic, not at the start of it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFua2xuYmK4psLIp2Sor5WjwG7D1p5knKeeqb%2Bir9NmnLGomaeytHnJmqWumaKuenR9jGtna2o%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
