One fan on Twitter <a href=#>wrote:</a> "We throw around underrated a lot, but Lance Reddick truly was one of the most underrated actors of our time. I'm going to miss him very much. Rest in peace, sir. You've earned it." Another person echoed similar sentiments before highlighting his bittersweet role in Disney+'s upcoming "Percy Jackson and the Olympians" series. "Lance Reddick is gone before one of his final performances comes out where we see him play king of the gods, as Zeus, and it's going to take on a whole new meaning now," <a href=#>they tweeted</a>. "Rest in peace to an immensely talented man."</p><p>Fans weren't the only ones to share their condolences on social media. "Guardians of the Galaxy" director <a href=#>James Gunn also uploaded a heartfelt statement to Twitter</a>, praising the "Oz" star for being an "incredibly nice guy and an incredibly talented actor." Gunn further added, "This is heartbreaking. My love goes out to all his family, friends, and collaborators." Lastly, Reddick's "The Wire" cast mate Wendell Pierce –– who played Detective William Moreland in the HBO drama –– described the late actor as the "epitome of class." "A man of great strength and grace. As talented a musician as he was an actor ... You made your mark here. RIP," <a href=#>he tweeted.</a> Reddick's death came a day after he uploaded a loving post about his dogs on <a href=#>Instagram.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampjZoNzgo6tn55lpKeuqLXCZpuemaSderCyjK2fnmWnnr%2BmedKtmKtlnJa7pLGMq5ydnJmYuHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
