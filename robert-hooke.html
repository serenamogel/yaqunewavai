Who Was Robert Hooke?Scientist Robert Hooke was educated at Oxford and spent his career at the Royal Society and Gresham College. His research and experiments ranged from astronomy to biology to physics; he is particularly recognized for the observations he made while using a microscope and for &#34;Hooke's Law&#34; of elasticity. Hooke died in London in 1703.
Early Life and EducationRobert Hooke was born in the town of Freshwater, on England’s Isle of Wight, on July 18, 1635."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

His research and experiments ranged from astronomy to biology to physics; he is particularly recognized for the observations he made while using a microscope and for "Hooke's Law" of elasticity. Hooke died in London in 1703.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Education</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Robert Hooke was born in the town of Freshwater, on England’s Isle of Wight, on July 18, 1635. His parents were John Hooke, who served as curate for the local church parish, and Cecily (née Gyles) Hooke.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Initially a sickly child, Hooke grew to be a quick learner who was interested in painting and adept at making mechanical toys and models. After his father’s death in 1648, the 13-year-old Hooke was sent to London to apprentice with painter Peter Lely. This connection turned out to be a short one, and he went instead to study at London’s Westminster School.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1653, Hooke enrolled at Oxford's Christ Church College, where he supplemented his meager funds by working as an assistant to the scientist Robert Boyle. While studying subjects ranging from astronomy to chemistry, Hooke also made influential friends, such as future architect Christopher Wren.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Teaching, Research and Other Occupations</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hooke was appointed curator of experiments for the newly formed Royal Society of London in 1662, a position he obtained with Boyle's support. Hooke became a fellow of the society in 1663.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Unlike many of the gentleman scientists he interacted with, Hooke required an income. In 1665, he accepted a position as professor of geometry at Gresham College in London. After the "Great Fire" destroyed much of London in 1666, Hooke became a city surveyor. Working with Wren, he assessed the damage and redesigned many of London’s streets and public buildings.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Major Discoveries and Achievements</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A true polymath, the topics Hooke covered during his career include comets, the motion of light, the rotation of Jupiter, gravity, human memory and the properties of air. In all of his studies and demonstrations, he adhered to the scientific method of experimentation and observation. Hooke also utilized the most up-to-date instruments in his many projects.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hooke’s most important publication was Micrographia, a 1665 volume documenting experiments he had made with a microscope. In this groundbreaking study, he coined the term "cell" while discussing the structure of cork. He also described flies, feathers and snowflakes, and correctly identified fossils as remnants of once-living things.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The 1678 publication of Hooke's Lectures of Spring shared his theory of elasticity; in what came to be known as "Hooke’s Law," he stated that the force required to extend or compress a spring is proportional to the distance of that extension or compression. In an ongoing, related project, Hooke worked for many years on the invention of a spring-regulated watch.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life and Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hooke never married. His niece, Grace Hooke, his longtime live-in companion and housekeeper, as well as his eventual lover, died in 1687; Hooke was inconsolable at the loss.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hooke's career was marred by arguments with other prominent scientists. He often sparred with fellow Englishman <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/scientists/isaac-newton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Isaac Newton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Isaac Newton</a>, including one 1686 dispute over Hooke’s possible influence on Newton’s famous book Principia Mathematica.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In his last year of life, Hooke suffered from symptoms that may have been caused by diabetes. He died at the age of 67 in London on March 3, 1703.</p><ul data-node-id=21 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Robert Hooke</li><li>Birth Year: 1635</li><li>Birth date: July 18, 1635</li><li>Birth City: Freshwater, Isle of Wight</li><li>Birth Country: England</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Robert Hooke is known as a "Renaissance Man" of 17th century England for his work in the sciences, which covered areas such as astronomy, physics and biology.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Education and Academia</li><li>Journalism and Nonfiction</li><li>Architecture</li><li>Business and Industry</li><li>Science and Medicine</li><li>Technology and Engineering</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Cancer</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Wadham College</li></ul><li>Death Year: 1703</li><li>Death date: March 3, 1703</li><li>Death City: London</li><li>Death Country: England</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=24><ul data-node-id=26 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Robert Hooke Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/scientists/robert-hooke</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: June 22, 2020</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiqnKGVo8Gqv9OsZqunkpq%2FtXnHqKaknQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
