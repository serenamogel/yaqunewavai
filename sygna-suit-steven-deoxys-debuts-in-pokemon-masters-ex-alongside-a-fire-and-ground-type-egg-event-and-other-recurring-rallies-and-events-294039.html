Though not yet formally stated in the promotional materials, if this debut follows the same pattern as other sync pairs debuts during this Hoenn Arc, then this new sync pair should have an expanded sync grid, as well as the ability to be raised to 6★ EX, which would increase the pair's stats as well as giving Steven an outfit change based on Deoxys's appearance.</p><p>Sygna Suit Steven & Deoxys are a Psychic-type tech sync pair. Deoxys can be changed into one of its four forms, each with their own specialty.</p><p>This Scout will be available until August 27th, at 10:59pm (PT).</p><p><span data-s9e-mediaembed=youtube><span><span data-s9e-mediaembed-iframe='["allowfullscreen","","scrolling","no","style","background:url(https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6UP3q2HWeNc\/hqdefault.jpg) 50% 50% \/ cover","src","https:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/embed\/6UP3q2HWeNc"]'></span></span></span>​</p><br><b><u>Version 2.23.5 Update Summary</u></b><br>A minor update to Pokémon Masters EX has been released, reportedly making several small text changes, as well as implementing other bug fixes and improvements.

One limited-time incubator will also be added to Bellis's Lab for the duration of this event. If an Egg is still in the limited-time incubator when the event ends, the limited-time incubator will remain active until that Egg hatches.</p><p>As usual for events of this type, several special missions will be available during the event period. Players will have an increased chance of receiving Eggs if they take on event battles using teams that feature specific sync pairs. The more of these sync pairs are placed in the lineup, the higher the Egg reward rate will be.</p><p>The applicable Sync Pairs and Egg reward rates are as follows:<br></p><ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>Fire-type and Ground-type Main Character sync pairs: +80% (×1.8) Egg Reward Rate</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>Main Character Sync Pairs: +40% (×1.4) Egg Reward Rate</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>Other Fire- and Ground-type sync pairs: +20% Egg Reward Rate (×1.2)</li></ul>These bonuses stack additively, so having 1 Main Character Fire- or Ground-Type Sync Pair, and two other Fire- or Ground-Type sync pairs would give a combined bonus of +120% (x2.2)<p>Players should also note the following when playing this event:<br></p><ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>To participate, players must have completed Main Story Chapter 1: The More the Merrier (Normal) in single-player.</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>The sync pairs that appear as opponents in battle have different capabilities than those players can actually obtain.</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>All mission completion rewards must be claimed within three days of the mission period ending.</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>Players cannot receive Eggs from Professor Bellis by completing areas outside of this event during this event period.</li></ul><b><u>Bonus Rallies</u><br>Training Area Reward Boost Rally</b><br>Until August 14th at 10:59pm (PT), players will receive extra rewards for completing Training area stages as part of a Training Area Reward Boost Rally.
